	abstract = {The effects on the convective boundary layer (CBL) of surface heterogeneities produced by surface sensible heat flux waves with different means, amplitudes, and wavelengths were investigated here. The major objective of this study was to evaluate at which scale surface heterogeneity starts to significantly affect the heat fluxes in the CBL. The large-eddy simulation option of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System developed at Colorado State University was used for that purpose. Avissar et al. evaluated this model against observations and demonstrated its reliability. It appears that the impact of amplitude and wavelength of a heat wave is nonlinearly dependent upon the mean heating rate. The circulations (or rolls) resulting from surface heterogeneity are strong when the amplitude and the wavelength of the heat wave are large, especially at low mean heating rate. In that case the profiles of horizontally averaged variables are quite strongly modified in the CBL. The potential temperature is not constant with elevation, and the sensible heat flux considerably departs from the linear variation with height obtained in a typical CBL that develops over a homogeneous domain. The mean turbulence kinetic energy profile depicts two maxima, one near the ground surface and one near the top of the CBL, corresponding to the strong horizontal flow that develops near the ground surface and the return flow at the top of the CBL. In a dry atmosphere, a weak background wind of 2.5 m s?1 is strong enough to considerably reduce the impact of ground-surface heterogeneity on the CBL. A moderate background wind of 5 m s?1 virtually eliminates all impacts that could potentially be produced in realistic landscapes. Water vapor does not significantly affect the CBL. However, the formation of rolls at preferential locations within the heterogeneous domain results in {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}pockets{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} of high moisture concentration, which have a strong potential for clouds formation. Such clouds may not form over homogeneous domains where moisture is more uniformly distributed, and the CBL is not as high as in heterogeneous domains. From this study, it can be concluded that as long as the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}patchiness{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} of the landscape has a characteristic length scale smaller than about 5{\textendash}10 km (even without background wind), the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}mosaic of tiles{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} type of land surface scheme suggested by Avissar and Pielke can be applied to represent the land surface in atmospheric models. At larger scales, the impact of landscape heterogeneity may be significant, especially when the atmosphere is humid. Therefore, this study supports previous estimates, which were based on theoretical analyses.},

Large-eddy simulations (LES), driven by observed near-surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, were performed for the diurnal cycle and compare well with observations. As in former studies of idealized one- and two-dimensional heterogeneities, secondary circulations developed that are superimposed on the turbulent field and that partly take over the vertical transport of heat and moisture. The secondary circulation patterns vary between local and roll-like structures, depending on the background wind conditions. For higher background wind speeds, the flow feels an effective surface heat-flux pattern that derives from the original pattern by streamwise averaging. This effective pattern generates a roll-like secondary circulation with roll axes along the mean boundary-layer wind direction. Mainly the upstream surface conditions control the secondary circulation pattern, where the fetch increases with increasing background wind speed. Unlike the entrainment flux that appears to be slightly decreased compared to the homogeneously-heated CBL, the vertical flux of sensible heat appears not to be modified in the mixed layer, while the vertical flux of latent heat shows different responses to secondary circulations. The study illustrates that sufficient time averaging and ensemble averaging is required to separate the heterogeneity-induced signals from the raw LES turbulence data. This might be an important reason why experiments over heterogeneous terrain in the past did not give any clear evidence of heterogeneity-induced effects.},

	abstract = {A large-eddy simulation (LES) study is presented that investigates the spatial variability of temporal eddy covariance fluxes and the systematic underestimation of representative fluxes linked to them. It extends a prior numerical study by performing high resolution simulations that allow for virtual measurements down to 20 m in a convective boundary layer, so that conditions for small tower measurement sites can be analysed. It accounts for different convective regimes as the wind speed and the near-surface heat flux are varied. Moreover, it is the first LES imbalance study that extends to the stable boundary layer. It reveals shortcomings of single site measurements and the necessity of using horizontally-distributed observation networks. The imbalances in the convective case are attributed to a locally non-vanishing mean vertical advection due to turbulent organised structures (TOS). The strength of the TOS and thus the imbalance magnitude depends on height, the horizontal mean wind and the convection type. Contrary to the results of a prior study, TOS cannot generally be responsible for large energy imbalances: at low observation heights (corresponding to small towers and near-surface energy balance stations) the TOS related imbalances are generally about one order of magnitude smaller than those in field experiments. However, TOS may cause large imbalances at large towers not only in the case of cellular convection and low wind speeds, as found in the previous study, but also in the case of roll convection at large wind speeds.},

	abstract = {Afforestation in semi-arid regions can potentially enhance the global carbon sink by increasing the terrestrial biomass. However, the survival of planted forests under such extreme environmental conditions is not guaranteed a priori, and critically depends on the surface{\textendash}atmosphere exchange of energy. We investigate the pine forest Yatir in Israel, an example of a man-made semi-arid ecosystem, by means of large-eddy simulations. We focus on the interaction between surface{\textendash}atmosphere exchange and secondary circulations that couple the isolated forest to the surrounding shrubland. The large-eddy simulations feature a grid resolution that resolves the forest canopy in several layers, and are initialized by satellite data and Doppler lidar, eddy-covariance and radiosonde measurements. We perform three largeeddy simulations with different geostrophic wind speeds to investigate the influence of those wind speeds on the surface{\textendash}atmosphere exchange. We reproduce the measured mean updrafts above the forest and mean downdrafts above the shrubland, which increase in strength with decreasing geostrophic wind speed. The largest updrafts emerge above the older, denser part of the forest, triggering secondary circulations. The spatial extent of these circulations does not cover the entire forest area, although we observe a reduced aerodynamic resistance in the regions of updraft. Our simulations indicate that the enhanced surface{\textendash}atmosphere exchange of the Yatir forest is not sufficient to compensate for the increased net radiation, due to the lower albedo of the forest with respect to the surroundings, resulting in higher air temperatures inside the forest. However, the difference between the forest and shrubland temperatures decreases with increasing geostrophic wind speed due to reduction in the aerodynamic resistance.},

	abstract = {Two Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) length scales are defined, to classify heterogeneous "patchwork-quilt" landscapes according to the nature and extent of the advective processes causing modification of the energy balance of any one patch by its surroundings. The two scales are a dynamic length scale Ut* (where U is the mean wind speed in the CBL and t* the convective eddy time scale) characterizing the downwind distance required for the CBL to become fully mixed after a transition, and UT (where Tis the time required for complete CBL equilibration, approximately the time since dawn) which characterizes the size of a patch which is energetically independent of its neighbours. These length scales define three kinds of heterogeneity, according to the typical along-wind patch dimension X: microscale heterogeneity (X {\textless} Ut*) for which inter-patch advection occurs in the surface layer and is maximum; mesoscale heterogeneity (Lfr* {\textless} X {\textless} UT) for which the CBL is well mixed but CBL-scale advection occurs; and macroscale heterogeneity (X {\textgreater} UT) for which advection is negligible and patches are energetically independent. Averaging schemes for surface fluxes are presented for the limiting cases of microscale and macroscale heterogeneity. The effect of changing X on the spatially averaged latent heat flux (over a heterogeneous landscape with specified area fractions of different surface types) is to reduce the flux with increasing X, but by a modest amount of less than 20\% in most cases.},

The sensitivity of the LES results to the spatial resolution and to the parameterizations of small-scale turbulence was investigated. It was shown that the resolved and partially resolved "subfilter-scale" eddies are mainly responsible for particle dispersion in LES, implying that substantial improvement 5 may be achieved by using recovery of small-scale velocity fluctuations. In LES with the explicit filtering this recovering consists of application of the known inverse filter operator. The footprint functions obtained in LES were compared with the functions calculated with the use of first-order single particle Lagrangian stochastic models (LSM), zeroth-order Lagrangian stochastic models - the random displacement models (RDM), and analytical footprint parameterisations. It was observed that the value of the Kolmogorov constant C0 = 6 provided the best agreement of the one-dimensional LSMs results with LES, 10 however, also that different LSMs can produce quite different footprint predictions. According to presented LES the source area and footprints in stable boundary layer can be substantially more extended than those predicted by the modern analytical footprint parameterizations and LSMs.},

	abstract = {The eddy-covariance technique tends to underestimate turbulent heat fluxes, which results in nonclosure of the surface energy balance. This study shows experimental evidence that mesoscale turbulent organized structures, which are inherently not captured by the standard eddy-covariance technique, can affect nearsurface turbulent exchange. By using a combined setup of three Doppler wind lidars above a croplanddominated area in Germany, low-frequency turbulent structures were detected in the surface layer down to a few meters above ground. In addition, data from two micrometeorological stations in the study area were analyzed with respect to energy balance closure. In accordance with several previous studies, the data confirm a strong friction velocity dependence of the energy balance residual. At both stations, the energy balance residual was found to be positively correlated with the vertical moisture gradient in the lower atmospheric boundary layer, but at only one station was it correlated with the temperature gradient. This result indicates that mesoscale transport probably contributes more to the latent heat flux than to the sensible heat flux, but this conclusion depends largely on the measurement site. Moreover, flow distortion due to tower mountings and measurement devices affects the energy balance closure considerably for certain wind directions.},

Analysing time series of turbulent variables thus requires extensive numerical treatment capable, for instance, of performing pattern recognition. This is particularly important in the case of the atmospheric surface layer and specifically in the vicinity of plant canopies, where largescale coherent motions play a major role in the dynamics of turbulent transport processes. In this paper, we examine the ability of the recently developed wavelet transform to extract information on turbulence structure from time series of wind velocities and scalars. It is introduced as a local transform performing a time-frequency representation of a given signal by a specific wavelet function; unlike the Fourier transform, it is well adapted to studying non-stationary signals. After the principles and the most relevant mathematical properties of wavelet functions and transform are given, we present various applications of relevance for our purpose: determination of time-scales, data reconstruction and filtering, and jump detection, Several wavelet functions are inter-compared, using simple artificially generated data presenting large-scale features similar to those observed over plant canopies. Their respective behaviour in the time-frequency domain leads us to assign a specific range of applications for each.},

The observations, part of the GAME-Siberia experiment, were recorded between April and June 2000 over the Lena River near Yakutsk City. A special integral parameter termed the {\textquoteleft}reduced depth of the CBL{\textquoteright} was used to scale the height of the mixed layer with variable depth. Analysis of wavelet cospectra and spectra facilitated the separation of fluxes and other variables into small-scale turbulent fluctuations (with scales less than the reduced depth of the CBL, approximately 2 km) and mesoscale fluctuations (up to 20 km). This separation approach allows for independent exploration of the scales. Analyses showed that vertical distributions obeyed different laws for small-scale fluxes and mesoscale fluxes (of sensible heat, water vapour, momentum and carbon dioxide) and for other variables (wind speed and air temperature fluctuations, coherence and degree of anisotropy). Vertical profiles of small-scale turbulent fluxes showed a strong decay that differed from generally accepted similarity models for the CBL. Vertical profiles of mesoscale fluxes and other variables clearly showed sharp inflections at the same relative (with respect to the reduced depth of the CBL) height of approximately 0.55 in the CBL. Conventional similarity models for sensible heat fluxes describe both small-scale turbulent and mesoscale flows. The present results suggest that mesoscale motions that reach up to the relative level of 0.55 could be initiated by thermal surface heterogeneity. Entrainment between the upper part of the CBL and the free atmosphere may cause mesoscale motions in that region of the CBL.},

Comparisons between Fourier and wavelet transform results are shown and they demonstrate, in conjunction with theoretical and experimental restrictions, that the Fourier transform method is not useful for studying non-homogeneous turbulence. The wavelet method is free from many disadvantages of Fourier analysis and can yield more informative results. Comparison of Fourier and Morlet wavelet spectra showed good agreement at high frequencies (small scales). The quality of the wavelet transform and corresponding software was estimated by comparing the original data with restored data constructed with an inverse wavelet transform. A Haar wavelet basis was inappropriate for the turbulence data; the {\textquoteleft}mother{\textquoteright} wavelet function recommended in this study is the Morlet wavelet. Good agreement was also shown between variances and covariances estimated with different mathematical techniques, i.e. through non-orthogonal wavelet spectra and through eddy correlation methods.

	abstract = {In mountain landscapes, surface temperatures vary over short distances due to interacting influences of topography and overstory vegetation on local energy and water balances. At two study landscapes in the Sierra Nevada of California, characterized by foothill oak savanna at 276{\textendash}481 m elevation and montane conifer forest at 1977{\textendash}2135 m, we deployed 288 near-surface (5 cm above the surface) temperature sensors to sample site-scale (30 m) temperature variation related to hillslope orientation and vegetation structure and microsite-scale (2{\textendash}10 m) variation related to microtopography and tree overstory. Daily near-surface maximum and minimum temperatures for the 2013 calendar year were related to topographic factors and vegetation overstory characterized using small footprint LiDAR imagery acquired by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). At both landscapes we recorded large site and microsite spatial variation in daily maximum temperatures, and less absolute variation in daily minimum temperatures. Generalized boosted regression trees were estimated to measure the influence of tree canopy density, understory solar radiation, cold-air drainage and pooling, ground cover and microtopography on daily maximum and minimum temperatures at site and microsite scales. Site-scale models based on indices of understory solar radiation and landscape position explained an average of 61{\textendash}65\% of daily variation in maximum temperature; site-scale models based on tree canopy density and landscape position explained 65{\textendash}83\% of variation in minimum temperatures. Models explained {\textless} 15\% of variation in microsite-scale maximum temperatures but within-site heterogeneity was significantly correlated with within-site heterogeneity in modeled understory radiation at both landscapes. Tree canopy density and slope explained 33\% of microsite-scale variation in minimum temperatures at savanna sites. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to model site-scale variation in daily surface temperature extremes and within-site heterogeneity in surface temperatures using LiDAR-derived variables, supporting efforts to understand cross-scale relationships between surface microclimates and regional climate change. Improved understanding of topographic and vegetative buffering of thermal microclimates across mountain landscapes is key to projecting microclimate heterogeneity and potential species{\textquoteright} range dynamics under future climate change.},

	abstract = {In mountain landscapes, surface temperatures vary over short distances due to interacting influences of topography and overstory vegetation on local energy and water balances. At two study landscapes in the Sierra Nevada of California, characterized by foothill oak savanna at 276{\textendash}481 m elevation and montane conifer forest at 1977{\textendash}2135 m, we deployed 288 near-surface (5 cm above the surface) temperature sensors to sample site-scale (30 m) temperature variation related to hillslope orientation and vegetation structure and microsite-scale (2{\textendash}10 m) variation related to microtopography and tree overstory. Daily near-surface maximum and minimum temperatures for the 2013 calendar year were related to topographic factors and vegetation overstory characterized using small footprint LiDAR imagery acquired by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). At both landscapes we recorded large site and microsite spatial variation in daily maximum temperatures, and less absolute variation in daily minimum temperatures. Generalized boosted regression trees were estimated to measure the influence of tree canopy density, understory solar radiation, cold-air drainage and pooling, ground cover and microtopography on daily maximum and minimum temperatures at site and microsite scales. Site-scale models based on indices of understory solar radiation and landscape position explained an average of 61{\textendash}65\% of daily variation in maximum temperature; site-scale models based on tree canopy density and landscape position explained 65{\textendash}83\% of variation in minimum temperatures. Models explained {\textless} 15\% of variation in microsite-scale maximum temperatures but within-site heterogeneity was significantly correlated with within-site heterogeneity in modeled understory radiation at both landscapes. Tree canopy density and slope explained 33\% of microsite-scale variation in minimum temperatures at savanna sites. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to model site-scale variation in daily surface temperature extremes and within-site heterogeneity in surface temperatures using LiDAR-derived variables, supporting efforts to understand cross-scale relationships between surface microclimates and regional climate change. Improved understanding of topographic and vegetative buffering of thermal microclimates across mountain landscapes is key to projecting microclimate heterogeneity and potential species{\textquoteright} range dynamics under future climate change.},

Comparisons between Fourier and wavelet transform results are shown and they demonstrate, in conjunction with theoretical and experimental restrictions, that the Fourier transform method is not useful for studying non-homogeneous turbulence. The wavelet method is free from many disadvantages of Fourier analysis and can yield more informative results. Comparison of Fourier and Morlet wavelet spectra showed good agreement at high frequencies (small scales). The quality of the wavelet transform and corresponding software was estimated by comparing the original data with restored data constructed with an inverse wavelet transform. A Haar wavelet basis was inappropriate for the turbulence data; the {\textquoteleft}mother{\textquoteright} wavelet function recommended in this study is the Morlet wavelet. Good agreement was also shown between variances and covariances estimated with different mathematical techniques, i.e. through non-orthogonal wavelet spectra and through eddy correlation methods.

Although previous studies suggest the dominant thermodynamic processes involved in deep convection may differ between land and ocean, a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamics of Amazonian convection is lacking. Using 404,971 daytime precipitating cloud profiles from the CloudSat satellite, we observe a regime transition from congestus dominance to cumulonimbus dominance when convective available potential energy exceeds a threshold in Amazonia and also in shrublands, but not in oceanic regions. In addition, the cloud regime transition is linked to boundary layer moisture in the two continental regions, while it is linked to lower-freetropospheric moisture in the oceanic region. As the dry season progresses in Amazonia and modifies the free-tropospheric stability, a moderate plant water stress and increased incoming solar energy facilitate the initiation of deep convection and the onset of the wet season. Plain Language Summary This paper presents new analyses of satellite observations that link the atmospheric energetics and vertical structure of daytime precipitating clouds, focusing on the unique features over the Amazon rainforest. The dominant cloud type over the Amazon rainforest is similar to the dominant cloud type observed in oceanic regions most time of the year, so it is often regarded as a {\textquotedblleft}Green Ocean.{\textquotedblright} However, here we show a continental cloud regime transition from midlevel cloud dominance to deep cloud dominance when atmospheric buoyant energy or boundary layer moisture exceeds a threshold in Amazonian rainforests.},

The MEC feedback has been proposed to be crucial to spontaneous convective aggregation. Here we test this hypothesis by performing minimal cloud-resolving simulations, without the buoyancy effect due to water vapor, evaporation of rain, or radiative and surface-flux feedbacks. Convection can self-aggregate in this minimal simulation, in which the MEC feedback is active. We then switch off this feedback by relaxing moisture to its horizontal mean over a time scale of 3 hr. Convection still self-aggregates in this mechanism-denial experiment, suggesting that the MEC feedback is not essential to self-aggregation. We further show that convective heating coincides with positive temperature anomalies, generating available potential energy. Therefore, we propose that this convective heating-overturning circulation feedback can lead to spontaneous development of large-scale circulations.},

	abstract = {We use a large-eddy simulation model with a nested domain configuration (297 and 120 km wide) and an interactive land surface parameterization to simulate the complex population of shallow clouds observed on 30 August 2016 during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems campaign conducted in north-central Oklahoma. Shallow convective clouds first formed over southeast Oklahoma and then spread toward the northwest into southern Kansas. By the early afternoon, the relatively uniform shallow cloud field became more complex in which some regions became nearly cloud free and in other regions larger shallow clouds developed with some transitioning to deeper, precipitating convection. We show that the model reproduces the observed heterogeneity in the cloud populations only when realistic variations in soil moisture are used to initialize the model. While more variable soil moisture and to a lesser extent cool lake temperatures drive the initial spatial heterogeneity in the cloud populations, precipitation-driven cold pools become an important factor after 1300 CST. When smoother soil moisture variations are used in the model, more uniform shallow cloud populations are predicted with far fewer clouds that transition to deeper, precipitating convection that produce cold pools. An algorithm that tracks thousands of individual cumulus show that the more realistic soil moisture distributions produces clouds that are larger and have a longer lifetime. The results suggest that shallow and deep convection parameterizations used by mesoscale models need to account for the effects of variable land-atmosphere interactions and cold pools. Plain Language Summary Models that resolve boundary layer turbulence and clouds have been used extensively to better understand processes controlling the life cycle of shallow convective clouds. Because of their computational expense these models usually employ relatively small domain sizes, usually less than 50 km wide, and constrain the atmospheric forcing so that the predicted clouds are nearly uniformly distributed in space. We employ a more realistic modeling approach to represent the observed complex cloud distributions over Oklahoma on a day during a recent atmospheric sampling campaign. The model results suggest that the observed cloud distributions were caused by two processes that can occur at the same time. During the morning, spatial variations in soil moisture perturbed the heating patterns and altered the timing and intensity of cloud formation. Then during the afternoon cold pools further perturbed the clouds, producing clear skies in some regions and enhancing cloud formation in other regions. While cooler air from evaporating precipitation suppresses cloud formation, cloud formation is enhanced at the edges of the expanding pool of colder air. These processes are missing or treated simply in numerical representations of convective clouds by operational forecasting and climate models that may affect predictions of cloudiness and initiation of precipitation.},

The profiles of sensible heat flux and the temporal evolution of the boundary-layer depth revealed decreased entrainment for small heat-flux amplitudes and increased entrainment for large heat-flux amplitudes, compared to the homogeneously-heated mixed layer. For large heat-flux amplitudes the largest entrainment was observed for patch sizes in the order of the boundary-layer depth, while for significantly smaller or larger patch sizes entrainment was similar as in the homogeneous case. In order to understand the underlying physics of this impact, a new approach was developed to infer local information on entrainment by means of the local flux divergence. We found an entrainment maximum over the centre of the stronger heated surface patch, where thermal energy is accumulated by the secondary circulation (SC) that was induced by the surface heterogeneity. Furthermore, we observed an entrainment maximum over the less heated patch as well, which we suppose is to be linked to the SC-induced horizontal flow convergence at the top of the convective boundary layer (CBL). For small heat-flux amplitudes a counteracting effect dominates that decreases entrainment, which we suppose is the horizontal advection of cold air in the lower, and warm air in the upper, CBL by the SC, stabilizing the CBL and thus weakening thermal convection. Moreover, we found that a mean wind can reduce the heterogeneity-induced impact on entrainment. If the flow is aligned perpendicular to the border between the differentially-heated patches, the SC and thus its impact on entrainment vanishes due to increased horizontal mixing, even for moderate wind speeds. However, if the flow is directed parallel to the border between the differentially-heated patches, the SC and thus its impact on entrainment persists.},

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {The effects on the convective boundary layer (CBL) of surface heterogeneities produced by surface sensible heat flux waves with different means, amplitudes, and wavelengths were investigated here. The major objective of this study was to evaluate at which scale surface heterogeneity starts to significantly affect the heat fluxes in the CBL. The large-eddy simulation option of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System developed at Colorado State University was used for that purpose. Avissar et al. evaluated this model against observations and demonstrated its reliability. It appears that the impact of amplitude and wavelength of a heat wave is nonlinearly dependent upon the mean heating rate. The circulations (or rolls) resulting from surface heterogeneity are strong when the amplitude and the wavelength of the heat wave are large, especially at low mean heating rate. In that case the profiles of horizontally averaged variables are quite strongly modified in the CBL. The potential temperature is not constant with elevation, and the sensible heat flux considerably departs from the linear variation with height obtained in a typical CBL that develops over a homogeneous domain. The mean turbulence kinetic energy profile depicts two maxima, one near the ground surface and one near the top of the CBL, corresponding to the strong horizontal flow that develops near the ground surface and the return flow at the top of the CBL. In a dry atmosphere, a weak background wind of 2.5 m s?1 is strong enough to considerably reduce the impact of ground-surface heterogeneity on the CBL. A moderate background wind of 5 m s?1 virtually eliminates all impacts that could potentially be produced in realistic landscapes. Water vapor does not significantly affect the CBL. However, the formation of rolls at preferential locations within the heterogeneous domain results in {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}pockets{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} of high moisture concentration, which have a strong potential for clouds formation. Such clouds may not form over homogeneous domains where moisture is more uniformly distributed, and the CBL is not as high as in heterogeneous domains. From this study, it can be concluded that as long as the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}patchiness{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} of the landscape has a characteristic length scale smaller than about 5{\textendash}10 km (even without background wind), the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}mosaic of tiles{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} type of land surface scheme suggested by Avissar and Pielke can be applied to represent the land surface in atmospheric models. At larger scales, the impact of landscape heterogeneity may be significant, especially when the atmosphere is humid. Therefore, this study supports previous estimates, which were based on theoretical analyses.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of observed surface heterogeneities during the LITFASS-2003 experiment on the convective boundary layer (CBL). Large-eddy simulations (LES), driven by observed near-surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, were performed for the diurnal cycle and compare well with observations. As in former studies of idealized one- and two-dimensional heterogeneities, secondary circulations developed that are superimposed on the turbulent field and that partly take over the vertical transport of heat and moisture. The secondary circulation patterns vary between local and roll-like structures, depending on the background wind conditions. For higher background wind speeds, the flow feels an effective surface heat-flux pattern that derives from the original pattern by streamwise averaging. This effective pattern generates a roll-like secondary circulation with roll axes along the mean boundary-layer wind direction. Mainly the upstream surface conditions control the secondary circulation pattern, where the fetch increases with increasing background wind speed. Unlike the entrainment flux that appears to be slightly decreased compared to the homogeneously-heated CBL, the vertical flux of sensible heat appears not to be modified in the mixed layer, while the vertical flux of latent heat shows different responses to secondary circulations. The study illustrates that sufficient time averaging and ensemble averaging is required to separate the heterogeneity-induced signals from the raw LES turbulence data. This might be an important reason why experiments over heterogeneous terrain in the past did not give any clear evidence of heterogeneity-induced effects.},

	abstract = {The influence of land surface heterogeneity on potential cloud formation is investigated using relative humidity as an indicator. This is done by performing numerical experiments using a large-eddy simulation model (LES). The land surface in the model was divided into two patches that had the same sum of latent and sensible heat flux but different Bowen ratios to simulate heterogeneous land surfaces. For heterogeneity in the meso-/// scale (2{\textendash}20 km), sensitivity analyses were carried out on the heterogeneity amplitude (Bowen ratio difference between contrasting areas) and the inversion strength of potential temperature and specific humidity. The competition between absolute temperature decrease by ABL growth and dry air entrainment in heterogeneous conditions is analyzed using the LES results. First, it is shown that entrainment is located and enhanced over patches with higher Bowen ratios (warm patches) than their surroundings (cold patches). The heterogeneity-induced strong thermals can further penetrate the inversion at the ABL top, thereby reaching lower absolute temperatures than in homogeneous conditions. Second, because of the heterogeneity-induced circulations the moisture is located over the warm patch, and higher timeaveraged RH values at the ABL top (RHzi) than over the cold patches are found here, even for dry atmospheres. These RHzi exceed values found over homogeneous land surfaces and are an indication that surface heterogeneity may facilitate cloud formation. In vertical profiles of RH, few differences are found between the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, but the essential heterogeneity-induced modifications are within the domain variability.},

	abstract = {Idealized large-eddy simulations (LESs) with prescribed heterogeneous land surface heat fluxes are performed to study the impact of the heterogeneity length scale and background wind speed on the development of shallow cumulus and the subsequent transition to congestus/deep convection. We study the impact of land surface heterogeneity in an atmosphere that favors shallow convection but is also conditionally unstable with respect to deeper convection. We find that before the convection transition, larger and thicker shallow cumulus clouds are attached to moisture pools near the PBL top over patches with low evaporative fraction (referred to as {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}DRY{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}). This feature is attributable to a surface-induced secondary circulation whose development depends on the heterogeneity size and the background wind speed. With large patches (\$5 km) under zero ambient wind, the secondary mesoscale circulation promotes the vertical transport of moisture forming a moisture pool over DRY patches, while with smaller patches, no such circulation develops. The influence of the background wind on the secondary circulation is strong such that any wind stronger than 2 m s21 effectively eliminates the impact of surface heterogeneity on the PBL and brings no secondary circulation. This is because the triggered secondary circulation is not strong enough to withstand the imposed background wind. Based on these, we propose two criteria for the convection transition, namely, that the heterogeneity length scale is greater than 5 km and that the background wind speed is less than Uc0, where Uc0 is the near-surface cross-patch wind speed of the secondary circulation under zero background wind for a given patch size and is about 1.5 m s21 in our cases.},

Recent experiments, deliberately conducted in non-ideal conditions, show an underestimation of turbulent fluxes. Results from the field experiments FIFE, KUREX, TARTEX and SADE, point to a relationship between the underestimation of turbulent fluxes and terrain inhomogeneity. In order to systematically correct for this effect a scheme is suggested which uses fetch lengths of different types of surface in the sites surrounding the environment. In addition, horizontal differences in atmospheric stability above different surfaces are included in the correction scheme.

It appears that because of the strong, non-linear response of the atmosphere to the spatial variability of land-surface characteristics, the scaling of hydrological processes and parameters is not linear. This implies that appropriate hydrological schemes for atmospheric models need to provide higher statistical moments and characteristic length scales of the spatial distribution of water availability for evapotranspiration.},

Here, measured 10 Hz time series of vertical velocity, air temperature, and water vapor density collected in the ASL are analyzed for conditions where entrainment and/or horizontal advection separately predominate. The series are decomposed into small- and large- eddies based on a frequency cutoff and their contributions to turbulent fluxes are analyzed. Phase difference between vertical velocity and water vapor density associated with large eddies reduces latent heat fluxes, especially in conditions where advection prevails.

The results showed that 1) the EBR was in the range of 0.78{\textendash}1.04 at all sites with an average EBR of 0.92, and 2) the calculated daily EBR exhibited better performance than the 30-min averages. 3) The heat storage cannot be ignored during the crop growing season.

The results also showed that 4) the land heterogeneous surface had a significant effect on the EBR. The EBR decreased with land surface heterogeneity increasing (taking the standard deviation of the surface temperature in the eddy covariance system source area as an index). The EBR also decreased when irrigation occurred and increased after irrigation was completed.

	abstract = {It is well known that the available energy (i.e., the net radiation minus the ground heat flux) is often 10{\textendash}30\% larger than the sum of turbulent fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance method. Although field observations and previous large-eddy simulation studies have shown that surface heterogeneity can induce flux imbalance, the relationship between the flux imbalance magnitude and the surface heterogeneity scale remains to be investigated in more detail. Here we examine the flux imbalance over landscapes characterized by different surface heterogeneity scales in a dry freely convective boundary layer. We reveal that the flux imbalance initially increases with increasing surface heterogeneity scale. However, when the surface heterogeneity scale becomes larger than the boundary layer height, the surface starts to behave locally homogeneous, which leads to a lower flux imbalance. Based on large-eddy simulation results, we propose a conceptual model to explain how the domain average flux imbalance is influenced by surface heterogeneity. The flux imbalance is found to be controlled by the ratio of the boundary layer height to the Obukhov length (-zi/L), the integral length scale of vertical velocity (lw), the mean horizontal speed (U), and the time averaging interval (T). Among these four variables, lw determines the size of turbulent coherent structures (i.e., large eddies), whereas -zi/L affects the form of these large eddies. Meanwhile, the U and T determine how many these large eddies can be sampled by the eddy covariance. This finding indicates that it may be possible to diagnose the flux imbalance using these four variables under convective conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The goal of this study is to characterize the sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat exchange for different land covers in the heterogeneous steppe landscape of the Xilin River catchment, Inner Mongolia, China. Eddy-covariance flux measurements at 50{\textendash}100 m above ground were conducted in July 2009 using a weight-shift microlight aircraft. Wavelet decomposition of the turbulence data enables a spatial discretization of 90 m of the flux measurements. For a total of 8446 flux observations during 12 flights, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in each flux footprint are determined. Boosted regression trees are then used to infer an environmental response function (ERF) between all flux observations (H, LE) and biophysical (LST, EVI) and meteorological drivers. Numerical tests show that ERF predictions covering the entire Xilin River catchment (\&amp;approx;3670 km2) are accurate to <=18\% (1 $\sigma$). The predictions are then summarized for each land cover type, providing individual estimates of source strength (36 W m-2 {\textless} H {\textless} 364 W m-2, 46 W m-2 {\textless} LE {\textless} 425 W m-2) and spatial variability (11 W m-2 {\textless} $\sigma$H {\textless} 169 W m-2, 14 W m-2 {\textless} $\sigma$LE {\textless} 152 W m-2) to a precision of <=5\%. Lastly, ERF predictions of land cover specific Bowen ratios are compared between subsequent flights at different locations in the Xilin River catchment. Agreement of the land cover specific Bowen ratios to within 12 \&amp;pm; 9\% emphasizes the robustness of the presented approach. This study indicates the potential of ERFs for (i) extending airborne flux measurements to the catchment scale, (ii) assessing the spatial representativeness of long-term tower flux measurements, and (iii) designing, constraining and evaluating flux algorithms for remote sensing and numerical modelling applications.},

	abstract = {Eddy-covariance (EC) scalar-flux measurements suffer from unavoidable biases introduced by high-frequency losses in the sampled scalar concentration fluctuations. This bias alone leads to an underestimation of scalar fluxes by as much as 20\% in some cases, especially when a closed-path gas analyzer is used to sample concentration far from the inlet location. A novel method that directly corrects for these high-frequency losses using only the sampled scalar-concentration time series is proposed and tested. The sampled concentration fluctuation time series is adjusted, point-by-point, in the wavelet half-plane for each EC averaging interval (?30 min). Similarity between scalars (and temperature) is not necessary and a pre-defined theoretical shape of the cospectrum is not required, making this method attractive at meteorologically non-ideal sites. When closed-path gas analyzers are used to measure H2O concentration fluctuations, the method is shown to reproduce the dependence of the attenuation on air relative humidity. Nevertheless, the method is not able to account for excessively large spectral attenuation that occurs close to the spectral peak, as might be the case with long tubes and high relative humidity. Since the method corrects the original scalar concentration time series and not the cospectrum, other flow statistics{\textemdash}such as variances and integral time scales{\textemdash}are also adjusted. The proposed method can be used synergistically with conventional high-frequency cospectral correction methods given the differences in assumptions and approaches among these methods. When the conventional and the proposed methods agree, added confidence to the estimate of the high frequency correction is gained, and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Taylors{\textquoteright} frozen turbulence hypothesis suggests that all turbulent eddies are advected by the mean streamwise velocity, without changes in their properties. This hypothesis has been widely invoked to compute Reynolds averaging using temporal turbulence data measured at a single point in space. However, in the atmospheric surface layer, the exact relationship between convection velocity and wave number k has not been fully revealed since previous observations were limited by either their spatial resolution or by the sampling length. Using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), acquiring turbulent temperature fluctuations at high temporal and spatial frequencies, we computed convection velocities across wave numbers using a phase spectrum method. We found that convection velocity decreases as k{\`A}1/3 at the higher wave numbers of the inertial subrange instead of being independent of wave number as suggested by Taylor{\textquoteright}s hypothesis. We further corroborated this result using large eddy simulations. Applying Taylor{\textquoteright}s hypothesis thus systematically underestimates turbulent spectrum in the inertial subrange. A correction is proposed for point-based eddy-covariance measurements, which can improve surface energy budget closure and estimates of CO2 fluxes.},

We did not find consistent correlations between waterbody characteristics and the CH4 flux in the two study areas across the different resolutions. Our results indicate that waterbodies in permafrost landscapes, even if they seem to be emission hot spots on an individual basis or contain zones of above average emissions, do currently not necessarily translate into significant CH4 emission hot spots on a regional scale, but their role might change in a warmer climate.},

A footprint model with along-wind and cross-wind components was used to project the measured fluxes onto the surface map. The method was applied to measurements over Arctic tundra during the Mackenzie Area GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) Study (MAGS) 1999. The resulting flux estimates were computed by integration of a wavelet transform, and corrected for long wavelength losses using information from 100 km long regional runs that were conducted close to the grid flights. The random flux error was estimated based on the flight length that is represented in each map element, and a map resolution of 3 {\texttimes} 3 km was chosen in order to keep the average random error of the latent heat flux below 25\%. The random error of the sensible heat flux was smaller by a factor of 1.4 on average. An analysis of airborne flux measurements at different altitudes showed no significant increase of flux estimates for measurement heights below 90 m. Thus, the fluxes measured at heights between 48 and 64 m were not corrected for vertical flux divergence. The resulting flux maps provide quantitative two-dimensional estimates of the energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere during the snow melt period in an Arctic environment, which are well-suited for calibration and validation of numerical models.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the energy balance closure problem of single-tower eddycovariance measurements is linked to large-scale turbulent transport. In order to shed light on this problem, we investigate the functional dependence of the normalized residual for the potential temperature and humidity conservation equations, i.e. the imbalance ratio for the fluxes of latent and sensible heat. We set up a suite of simulations consisting of cases with different stability and surface Bowen ratio. We employ a nesting approach in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary-layer to achieve higher spatial resolution near the surface. Our simulations reproduce earlier simulation results for the mixed layer and also mimic the sawblade pattern of real flux measurements. Focusing on homogeneous terrain, we derive a parameterization for the spatially averaged flux imbalance ratios of latent and sensible heat in the surface layer. We also investigate how the remaining imbalance for a given point measurement is related to the local turbulence, by deriving a statistical model based on turbulence characteristics that are related to large-scale turbulence. The average imbalance ratio scales well with friction velocity, especially for sensible heat. For the latent heat flux, our results show that the Bowen ratio also influences the underestimation. Furthermore, in the surface layer the residual has a linear dependence on the absolute height divided by the boundary-layer height. Our parameterization allows us to deduce an expression for the residual in the energy budget for a particular measurement half hour, based on the measurement height and stability.},

	abstract = {In this study, the impact of varying soil moisture heterogeneity (spatial variance and structure) on the development of the convective boundary layer and shallow cumulus clouds was investigated. Applying soil moisture heterogeneity generated via spatially correlated Gaussian random fields based on a power law model and idealized atmospheric vertical profiles as initial conditions, three sets of large-eddy simulations provide insight in the influence of soil moisture heterogeneity on the ensuing growth of the convective boundary layer and development of shallow cumulus clouds. A sensitivity on the strong, weak, and unstructured soil moisture heterogeneity is investigated. The simulation results show that domain-averaged land surface sensible heat and latent heat flux change strongly with changing soil moisture variance because of the interactions between surface heterogeneity and induced circulations, while domain means of soil moisture are identical. Vertical profiles of boundary layer characteristics are strongly influenced by the surface energy partitioning and induced circulations, especially the profiles of liquid water and liquid water flux. The amount of liquid water and liquid water flux increases with increasing structure. In addition, the liquid water path is higher in case of strongly-structured heterogeneity because more available energy is partitioned into latent heat and more intensive updrafts exist. Interestingly, the increase of liquid water path with increasing soil moisture variance only occurs in the strongly structured cases, which suggests that soil moisture variance and structure work conjunctively in the surface energy partitioning and the cloud formation. Plain Language Summary The land surface is heterogeneous with respect to, for example, land use, plant cover, soil moisture, and topography over a wide range of spatial scales, which strongly influences the atmospheric boundary layer. In this study, the impact of soil moisture heterogeneity on the development of the convective boundary layer and shallow cumulus clouds was investigated. The results from a series of large-eddy simulations show that soil moisture heterogeneity impacts significantly on the surface energy partitioning, the convection boundary layer development and the cloud formation. Interestingly, the stronger soil moisture heterogeneity, the more available energy is partitioned into latent heat flux and the higher liquid water path in the atmosphere.},

Here we focus on the order of magnitude of the advection term in the equation of the evolution of temperature as generated by documented terrain heterogeneities and we estimate its importance as a term in the surface energy budget (SEB), for which the turbulent fluxes are computed using the eddycorrelation method. The heterogeneities are estimated from satellite and model fields for scales near 1 km or broader, while the smaller scales are estimated through direct measurements with remotely piloted aircraft and thermal cameras and also by high-resolution modelling. The variability of the surface temperature fields is not found to decrease clearly with increasing resolution, and consequently the advection term becomes more important as the scales become finer. The advection term provides non-significant values to the SEB at scales larger than a few kilometres. In contrast, surface heterogeneities at the metre scale yield large values of the advection, which are probably only significant in the first centimetres above the ground. The motions that seem to contribute significantly to the advection term in the SEB equation in our case are roughly those around the hectometre scales.},

	abstract = {Monin{\textendash}Obukhov similarity theory is used in large-eddy simulation (LES) models as a surface boundary condition to predict the surface shear stress and scalar fluxes based on the gradients between the surface and the first grid level above the surface. We outline deficiencies of this methodology, such as the systematical underestimation of the surface shear stress, and propose a modified boundary condition to correct for this issue. The proposed boundary condition is applied to a set of LES for both neutral and stable boundary layers with successively decreasing grid spacing. The results indicate that the proposed boundary condition reliably corrects the surface shear stress and the sensible heat flux, and improves grid convergence of these quantities. The LES data indicate improved grid convergence for the surface shear stress, more so than for the surface heat flux. This is either due to a limited performance of the Monin{\textendash}Obukhov similarity functions or due to problems in the LES model in representing stable conditions. Furthermore, we find that the correction achieved using the proposed boundary condition does not lead to improved grid convergence of the wind-speed and temperature profiles. From this we conclude that the sensitivity of the windspeed and temperature profiles in the LES model to the grid spacing is more likely related to under-resolved near-surface gradients and turbulent mixing at the boundary-layer top, to the SGS model formulation, and/or to numerical issues, and not to deficiencies due to the use of improper surface boundary conditions.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

The model is optimized for use on massively parallel computer architectures. This is a follow-up paper to the PALM 4.0 model description in Maronga et al. (2015). During the last years, PALM has been significantly improved and now offers a variety of new components. In particular, much effort was made to enhance the model with components needed for applications in urban environments, like fully interactive land surface and radiation schemes, chemistry, and an indoor model. This paper serves as an overview paper of the PALM 6.0 model system and we describe its current model core. The individual components for urban applications, case studies, validation runs, and issues with suitable input data are presented and discussed in a series of companion papers in this special issue.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The goal of this study is to characterize the sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat exchange for different land covers in the heterogeneous steppe landscape of the Xilin River catchment, Inner Mongolia, China. Eddy-covariance flux measurements at 50{\textendash}100 m above ground were conducted in July 2009 using a weight-shift microlight aircraft. Wavelet decomposition of the turbulence data enables a spatial discretization of 90 m of the flux measurements. For a total of 8446 flux observations during 12 flights, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in each flux footprint are determined. Boosted regression trees are then used to infer an environmental response function (ERF) between all flux observations (H, LE) and biophysical (LST, EVI) and meteorological drivers. Numerical tests show that ERF predictions covering the entire Xilin River catchment (\&amp;approx;3670 km2) are accurate to <=18\% (1 $\sigma$). The predictions are then summarized for each land cover type, providing individual estimates of source strength (36 W m-2 {\textless} H {\textless} 364 W m-2, 46 W m-2 {\textless} LE {\textless} 425 W m-2) and spatial variability (11 W m-2 {\textless} $\sigma$H {\textless} 169 W m-2, 14 W m-2 {\textless} $\sigma$LE {\textless} 152 W m-2) to a precision of <=5\%. Lastly, ERF predictions of land cover specific Bowen ratios are compared between subsequent flights at different locations in the Xilin River catchment. Agreement of the land cover specific Bowen ratios to within 12 \&amp;pm; 9\% emphasizes the robustness of the presented approach. This study indicates the potential of ERFs for (i) extending airborne flux measurements to the catchment scale, (ii) assessing the spatial representativeness of long-term tower flux measurements, and (iii) designing, constraining and evaluating flux algorithms for remote sensing and numerical modelling applications.},

	abstract = {Eddy-covariance measurements are widely used to develop and test parameterizations of landatmosphere interactions in earth system models. However, a fundamental challenge for model-data comparisons lies in the scale mismatch between the eddy-covariance observations with small (10-1{\textendash}101 km2) and temporally varying flux footprint, and the continuous regional-scale (102{\textendash}104 km2) gridded predictions made in simulations. Here, a new approach was developed to project turbulent flux maps at regional scale and hourly temporal resolution using environmental response functions (ERFs). This is based on an approach employed in airborne flux observations, and relates turbulent flux observations to meteorological forcings and surface properties across the flux footprint. In this study, the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 integrated over a 20 {\texttimes} 20 km2 target domain differed substantially from the tower observations in their expected value (+27\%, -9\%, and -17\%) and spatio-temporal variation (-22\%, -21\%, and -3\%, repsectively) ERF systematic uncertainties are bound within -11\%, -1.5\% and +16\%, respectively, indicating that tower location bias might be even more pronounced for heat and CO2 fluxes than currently detectable. The ERF-projected fluxes showed general agreement with independent observations at a nearby tower location. Lastly, advantages and limitations of ERF compared to other scaling approaches are discussed, and pathways for improving model-data synthesis utilizing the ERF scaling method are pointed out.},

	abstract = {The spatial variability of turbulent flow statistics in the roughness sublayer (RSL) of a uniform even-aged 14 m (= h) tall loblolly pine forest was investigated experimentally. Using seven existing walkup towers at this stand, high frequency velocity, temperature, water vapour and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured at 15.5 m above the ground surface from October 6 to 10 in 1997. These seven towers were separated by at least 100 m from each other. The objective of this study was to examine whether single tower turbulence statistics measurements represent the flow properties of RSL turbulence above a uniform even-aged managed loblolly pine forest as a best-case scenario for natural forested ecosystems. From the intensive space-time series measurements, it was demonstrated that standard deviations of longitudinal and vertical velocities ($\sigma$u, $\sigma$w) and temperature ($\sigma$T ) are more planar homogeneous than their vertical flux of momentum (u2*) and sensible heat (H ) counterparts. Also, the measured H is more horizontally homogeneous when compared to fluxes of other scalar entities such as CO2 and water vapour. While the spatial variability in fluxes was significant ({\textgreater}15\%), this unique data set confirmed that single tower measurements represent the {\textquoteleft}canonical{\textquoteright} structure of single-point RSL turbulence statistics, especially flux-variance relationships. Implications to extending the {\textquoteleft}moving-equilibrium{\textquoteright} hypothesis for RSL flows are discussed. The spatial variability in all RSL flow variables was not constant in time and varied strongly with spatially averaged friction velocity u*, especially when u* was small. It is shown that flow properties derived from two-point temporal statistics such as correlation functions are more sensitive to local variability in leaf area density when compared to single point flow statistics. Specifically, that the local relationship between the reciprocal of the vertical velocity integral time scale (Iw) and the arrival frequency of organized structures (u{\textasciimacron}/ h) predicted from a mixing-layer theory exhibited dependence on the local leaf area index. The broader implications of these findings to the measurement and modelling of RSL flows are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Eddy-covariance fluxes serve as an essential benchmark for Earth system models and remote sensing data. However, two challenges prevent model-data intercomparisons from fully utilizing eddy-covariance fluxes. The first challenge stems from the differing and variable spatial representativeness of the eddy-covariance measurements, or footprint bias and transience. The second originates from the phenomenon of a non-closed energy balance using eddy-covariance measurements, hypothesized to result from unaccounted mesoscale flows or under-sampling of hot spots by flux towers, among others. Previous studies have suggested that these two problems can be mitigated by either building multiple towers or by applying space{\textendash}time rectification approaches, such as the environmental response function (ERF) approach. Here we ask: (1) How many eddy-flux towers do we need to sufficiently rectify location bias, close the energy budget, and sample the regional domain? (2) Can an advanced space{\textendash}time rectification approach reduce the tower density, while still adequately sampling the regional flux domain? Furthermore, (3) How accurately can the ERF approach retrieve the surface-flux variation? To answer these questions, we used data from a largeeddy simulation of atmospheric flows above a heterogeneous surface as captured by an ensemble of virtual tower measurements. We calculated eddy-covariance fluxes by spatial and spatio-temporal methods. The spatial eddy-covariance method captured 89\% of the prescribed total surface energy flux with about one tower per 15 km2, while the spatio-temporal method required only one tower per 40 km2 to capture 95\% of surface energy. To capture 97\% of energy, applying the ERF approach further reduced the required tower density to one tower per 200 km2, as a result of space{\textendash}time rectification and incorporating mesoscale flows. This approach also enabled retrieving the surface spatial variation of the sensible heat flux. The results provide a reference for informing and designing future observation systems based on flux tower clusters, and scale-aware data products.},

The largest stress errors are shown to occur for unstable stratification (z/L {\textless} 0) and deep convective boundary layers. Three methods for determining the tilt angles relative to a mean streamline coordinate system and for computing the tilt-corrected stresses are then compared. The most commonly used method, involving a double rotation of the anemometers{\textquoteright} axes, is shown to result in significant run-to-run stress errors due to the sampling uncertainty of the mean vertical velocity. An alternative method, requiring a triple rotation of the anemometer axes, is shown to result in even greater run-to-run stress errors due to the combined sampling errors of the mean vertical velocity and the cross-wind stress. For measurements over the sea where the cross-stream stress is important, the double rotation method is shown to overestimate the surface stress, due to the uncorrected lateral tilt component. A third method, using a planar fit technique, is shown to reduce the run-to-run stress errors due to sampling effects, and provides an unbiased estimate of the lateral stress.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00435},
	abstract = {While advances in computation are enabling finer grid resolutions in numerical weather prediction models, representing land-atmosphere exchange processes as a lower boundary condition remains a challenge. This partially results of the fact that land-surface heterogeneity exists at all spatial scales and its variability does not `average' out with decreasing scales. The work here presented uses large-eddy simulations and the concept of dispersive fluxes to quantify the effect of surface thermal heterogeneity with scales \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1/10th the height of the atmospheric boundary layer and characterized by uniform roughness. Such near-canonical cases describe inhomogeneous scalar transport in an otherwise planar homogeneous flow when thermal stratification is weak or absent. Results illustrate a regime in which the flow is mostly driven by the surface thermal heterogeneities, in which the contribution of the dispersive fluxes can account for more than 40{\textbackslash}\% of the total sensible heat flux at about 0.1\$z\_i\$, with a value of 5 to 10{\textbackslash}\% near the surface, regardless of the spatial distribution of the thermal heterogeneities, and with a weak dependence on time averaging. Results also illustrate an alternative regime in which the effect of the surface thermal heterogeneities is quickly blended, and the dispersive fluxes match those obtained over an equivalent thermally homogeneous surface. This character seems to be governed by a new non-dimensional parameter representing the ratio of the large-scale advection effects to the convective turbulence. We believe that results from this research are a first step in developing new parameterizations appropriate for non-canonical atmospheric surface layer conditions.},

One case illustrates high-frequency retrieval of the top of a strongly convective boundary layer. A second case illustrates the retrieval of multiple layers in a complex, stably stratified region of the lower troposphere. The method is easily modified to allow for varying aerosol distributions and data quality.

	abstract = {In the first half of the twentieth century the measurement of rates of exchange of momentum, heat, and especially water between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere was an elusive challenge. A wide variety of methods evolved, ranging from reliance on drag plates, evaporation pans, and weighed lysimeters to a variety of methods based on measurement of vertical gradients in the air. None of these provided great confidence in the results. The promise of direct measurement by eddy covariance was held at bay by the lack of suitable fast-response instrumentation and the analytical requirement to average the products of pairs of these fast-response signals. Developments starting in the 1950s have now largely solved the problems that previously limited eddy covariance. Here, the history of flux measurement is summarized, and the path to now-standard capabilities is explored. The currently active major international programs making use of the modern instrumentation are addressed (with the focus on CO2 and CH4, as befitting global concerns regarding climate change), with particular attention to the emerging need to revisit the fetch and footprint constraints that confronted early workers. Finally, some areas of continuing uncertainty are mentioned, with an implicit request for increased experimental attention.},

	abstract = {Quantitative knowledge of the surface energy balance is essential for the prediction of weather and climate. However, a multitude of studies from around the world indicate that the turbulent heat fluxes are generally underestimated using eddy-covariance measurements, and hence, the energy balance is not closed. This energy-balance-closure problem, which has been heavily covered in the literature for more than 25 years, is the topic of the present review, in which we provide an overview of the potential reason for the lack of closure. We demonstrate the effects of the diurnal cycle on the energy balance closure, and address questions with regard to the partitioning of the energy balance residual between the sensible and the latent fluxes, and whether the magnitude of the flux underestimation can be predicted based on other variables typically measured at micrometeorological stations. Remaining open questions are discussed and potential avenues for future research on this topic are laid out. Integrated studies, combining multi-tower experiments and scale-crossing, spatially-resolving lidar and airborne measurements with high-resolution large-eddy simulations, are considered to be of critical importance for enhancing our understanding of the underlying transport processes in the atmospheric boundary layer.},

The estimated bottomup and top-down functions are qualitatively consistent with those from large-eddy simulation (LES) results and theoretical expectations. Newly fitted gradient functions are proposed based on observations for this forested site. The integrated bottom-up function over the lowest 4\% of the CBL depth estimated from the tower data is about five times larger than that from LES results for a {\textquoteleft}with-canopy{\textquoteright} case, and is smaller than that from LES results for a {\textquoteleft}no-canopy{\textquoteright} case by a factor of 0.7. We discuss the uncertainty in the evaluated gradient functions due to stability, wind direction, and uncertainty in the entrainment flux and show that while all of these have a significant impact on the gradient functions, none can explain the differences between the modelled and observed functions.

	title = {{AnEvaluationOfAircraftFluxMeasurements}},
	abstract = {Ground-based flux measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor integrate physiological processes taking place on a field scale. Aircraft flux measurements have recently been undertaken to attempt to widen the scope of applicability of such measurements. However, because of the intermittency of turbulent transfer, flux measurements must be averaged over long periods of time or long distances to give reproducible results. This requirement makes it difficult to relate aircraft flux measurements to local surface processes. Flux measurements of COz, latent and sensible heat obtained from repeated passes in four directions and at three elevations over a homogeneous wheat-growing area are compared with ground-based measurements. Averages based on four runs of 4 km in length gave results consistent with ground-based measurements. The largest percentage differences were in the sensible heat flux. Cospectral analyses showed no significant high frequency losses for the data from flight levels of 25 and 50 m, but an underestimation of approximately 10\% resulted at 10 m. Flight direction with respect to wind direction was relatively unimportant at 10 and 25 m but some effects were observed at 50 m. It was also shown that at 25 m, over a relatively smooth and homogeneous surface, the means of either three or four runs 4 km in length were similar to the means of 12-16 km runs. This confirms that at this altitude, most of the flux contribution is contained at wavelengths less than 4 km and that the mean of 3 to 4 passes accounts for most of the intermittency of turbulent transfer.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and quality of eddy-covariance flux measurements from a weight-shift microlight aircraft (WSMA). Firstly, we investigate the precision of the wind measurement ($\sigma$u,v <= 0.09 m s-1, $\sigma$w = 0.04 m s-1), the lynchpin of flux calculations from aircraft. From here, the smallest resolvable changes in friction velocity (0.02 m s-1), and sensible(5 W m-2) and latent (3 W m-2) heat flux are estimated. Secondly, a seven-day flight campaign was performed near Lindenberg (Germany). Here we compare measurements of wind, temperature, humidity and respective fluxes between a tall tower and the WSMA. The maximum likelihood functional relationship (MLFR) between tower and WSMA measurements considers the random error in the data, and shows very good agreement of the scalar averages. The MLFRs for standard deviations (SDs, 2{\textendash}34 \%) and fluxes (17{\textendash}21 \%) indicate higher estimates of the airborne measurements compared to the tower. Considering the 99.5 \% confidence intervals, the observed differences are not significant, with exception of the temperature SD. The comparison with a largeaperture scintillometer reveals lower sensible heat flux estimates at both tower (-40 to -25 \%) and WSMA (-25{\textendash}0 \%). We relate the observed differences to (i) inconsistencies in the temperature and wind measurement at the tower and (ii) the measurement platforms{\textquoteright} differing abilities to capture contributions from non-propagating eddies. These findings encourage the use of WSMA as a low cost and highly versatile flux measurement platform.},

	abstract = {Ground-based flux measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor integrate physiological processes taking place on a field scale. Aircraft flux measurements have recently been undertaken to attempt to widen the scope of applicability of such measurements. However, because of the intermittency of turbulent transfer, flux measurements must be averaged over long periods of time or long distances to give reproducible results. This requirement makes it difficult to relate aircraft flux measurements to local surface processes. Flux measurements of COz, latent and sensible heat obtained from repeated passes in four directions and at three elevations over a homogeneous wheat-growing area are compared with ground-based measurements. Averages based on four runs of 4 km in length gave results consistent with ground-based measurements. The largest percentage differences were in the sensible heat flux. Cospectral analyses showed no significant high frequency losses for the data from flight levels of 25 and 50 m, but an underestimation of approximately 10\% resulted at 10 m. Flight direction with respect to wind direction was relatively unimportant at 10 and 25 m but some effects were observed at 50 m.

However, in terms of validation, LES studies continue to largely focus on the first- and second-order statistics, which in fact are the same tests that Deardorff conducted 45 years ago. Further advances in LES and wider adoption for new flows require advanced and more challenging tests to be developed and documented to serve as benchmarks. The paper by Stevens, Wilczek \& Meneveau (J. Fluid Mech., 2014, vol. 757, pp. 888{\textendash}907) does precisely that. The authors demonstrate the ability of LES to capture the recently established log-law of streamwise velocity variance and the related log-laws for even-order statistics up to order 10, as well as the departure of these statistics from a Gaussian distribution. The paper also provides key insights into the role of grid resolution on the computed turbulence field.},

Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artificial parameter (i.e. the filter width or, more generally, the turbulence resolution length scale).

The review starts with the Smagorinsky model, but the focus is on dynamic and similarity subgrid models and on evaluating how well these models reproduce the true impact of the small scales on large-scale physics and how they perform in numerical simulations. Various criteria to evaluate the model performance are discussed, including the so-called a posteriori and a priori studies based on direct numerical simulation and experimental data. Issues are addressed mainly in the context of canonical, incompressible flows, but extensions to scalar-transport, compressible, and reacting flows are also mentioned.

	abstract = {A model is developed for the large-eddy simulation (LES) of heterogeneous atmosphere and land-surface processes. This couples a LES model with a land-surface scheme. New developments are made to the land-surface scheme to ensure the adequate representation of atmosphere{\textendash}land-surface transfers on the large-eddy scale. These include, (1) a multi-layer canopy scheme; (2) a method for flux estimates consistent with the large-eddy subgrid closure; and (3) an appropriate soil-layer configuration. The model is then applied to a heterogeneous region with 60-m horizontal resolution and the results are compared with ground-based and airborne measurements. The simulated sensible and latent heat fluxes are found to agree well with the eddy-correlation measurements. Good agreement is also found in the modelled and observed net radiation, ground heat flux, soil temperature and moisture. Based on the model results, we study the patterns of the sensible and latent heat fluxes, how such patterns come into existence, and how large eddies propagate and destroy land-surface signals in the atmosphere. Near the surface, the flux and land-use patterns are found to be closely correlated. In the lower boundary layer, small eddies bearing land-surface signals organize and develop into larger eddies, which carry the signals to considerably higher levels. As a result, the instantaneous flux patterns appear to be unrelated to the land-use patterns, but on average, the correlation between them is significant and persistent up to about 650 m. For a given land-surface type, the scatter of the fluxes amounts to several hundred W m-2, due to (1) large-eddy randomness; (2) rapid large-eddy and surface feedback; and (3) local advection related to surface heterogeneity.},

Twelve coupled land surface {\textendash} large eddy simulation scenarios with four different length scales of surface variability under three different horizontal wind speeds are used in the analysis. The base case uses Landsat ETM imagery over the Cloud Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC) field site for 3 June 2007. Using wavelets, the surface fields are band-pass filtered in order to maintain the spatial mean and variances to length scales of 200 m, 1600 m, and 12.8 km as lower boundary conditions to the model (approximately 0.25, 1.2 and 9.5 times boundary layer height). The simulations exhibit little variation in net radiation. Rather, there is a pronounced change in the partitioning of the surface energy between sensible and latent heat flux. The sensible heat flux is dominant for intermediate surface length scales. For smaller and larger scales of surface heterogeneity, which can be viewed as being more homogeneous, the latent heat flux becomes increasingly important. The simulations showed approximately 50 Wm-2 difference in the spatially averaged latent heat flux. The results reflect a general decrease of the Bowen ratio as the surface conditions transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous. Air temperature is less sensitive to variations in surface heterogeneity than water vapor, which implies that the role of surface heterogeneity may be to maximize convective heat fluxes through modifying and maintaining local temperature gradients. More homogeneous surface conditions (i.e. smaller length scales), on the other hand, tend to maximize latent heat flux. The intermediate scale (1600 m) this does not hold, and is a more complicated interaction of scales.},

We begin with a general overview of LES and then proceed to examine the SGS models developed for use in ABL{\textendash}LES. After this overview of the technique itself, we review the specific model developments tailored to the identified application areas and the scientific advancements realized using the LES technique in each area.

	abstract = {Forest processes that play an essential role in carbon sequestration, such as light use efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, and trace gas exchange, are closely tied to the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies. However, the vertical distribution of leaf traits is not uniform; leaves at varying vertical positions within the canopy are physiologically unique due to differing light and environmental conditions, which leads to higher carbon storage than if light conditions were constant throughout the canopy. Due to this within-canopy variation, three-dimensional structural traits are critical to improving our estimates of global carbon cycling and storage by Earth system models and to better understanding the effects of disturbances on carbon sequestration in forested ecosystems. In this study, we describe a reproducible and open-source methodology using the R programming language for estimating leaf area density (LAD; the total leaf area per unit of volume) from airborne LiDAR. Using this approach, we compare LAD estimates at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland, USA, from two airborne LiDAR systems, NEON AOP and NASA G-LiHT, which differ in survey and instrument specifications, collections goals, and laser pulse densities. Furthermore, we address the impacts of the spatial scale of analysis as well as differences in canopy penetration and pulse density on LAD and leaf area index (LAI) estimates, while offering potential solutions to enhance the accuracy of these estimates. LAD estimates from airborne LiDAR can be used to describe the three-dimensional structure of forests across entire landscapes. This information can help inform forest management and conservation decisions related to the estimation of aboveground biomass and productivity, the response of forests to large-scale disturbances, the impacts of drought on forest health, the conservation of bird habitat, as well as a host of other important forest processes and responses.},

	abstract = {Studying the microclimate of plant canopies has long motivated scientists in various research fields such as agronomy, ecology or silviculture, and almost a century has passed since the first measurements of wind speed in a forest stand were published in the scientific literature. The behaviour of wind in canopies is an essential component of their microclimate, which largely conditions the rate of exchange of heat, water vapour, and other gases and particles of interest with the atmosphere. This review examines the evolution of our understanding of turbulent flow in plant canopies, focussing on the period that covers the last fifty years (1970{\textendash}2020). We first describe how our knowledge and ideas have evolved since canopy flow became a topic of interest, and show how the 1970s was a pivotal decade in this field. Until then, canopy turbulence was considered to result from the superposition of standard surface-layer turbulence and small-scale turbulence generated in the wakes of plant elements. However, it was progressively found that the flow in plant canopies is dominated by large coherent structures, giving canopy turbulence unique characteristics. We thus describe the particular nature and structure of canopy flows, based on experimental observations accumulated over several decades. We show how canopy turbulence was reconsidered on the basis of a now widely-accepted analogy with a plane mixing layer, and we examine the significance of a key parameter, the {\textquotedblleft}canopy-shear length scale{\textquotedblright}. Investigating the effects of canopy density and atmospheric stability, we then discuss the extent of the mixing-layer analogy and the limits of our current understanding of canopy turbulence. Finally, we review the modelling tools used in this field and show how their development has evolved to date to meet our needs. In conclusion, we present a historical summary of the evolution of this research field and suggest future directions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The determination of area-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) at the satellite pixel scale/model grid scale over a heterogeneous land surface plays a significant role in developing and improving the parameterization schemes of the remote sensing based ET estimation models and general hydro-meteorological models. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) flux matrix provided a unique opportunity to build an aggregation scheme for area-averaged fluxes. On the basis of the HiWATER flux matrix dataset and high-resolution land-cover map, this study focused on estimating the area-averaged ET over a heterogeneous landscape with footprint analysis and multivariate regression. The procedure is as follows. Firstly, quality control and uncertainty estimation for the data of the flux matrix, including 17 eddy-covariance (EC) sites and four groups of large-aperture scintillometers (LASs), were carefully done. Secondly, the representativeness of each EC site was quantitatively evaluated; footprint analysis was also performed for each LAS path. Thirdly, based on the high-resolution land-cover map derived from aircraft remote sensing, a flux aggregation method was established combining footprint analysis and multiple-linear regression. Then, the area-averaged sensible heat fluxes obtained from the EC flux matrix were validated by the LAS measurements. Finally, the area-averaged ET of the kernel experimental area of HiWATER was estimated. Compared with the formerly used and rather simple approaches, such as the arithmetic average and area-weighted methods, the present scheme is not only with a much better database, but also has a solid grounding in physics and mathematics in the integration of area-averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous surface. Results from this study, both instantaneous and daily ET at the satellite pixel scale, can be used for the validation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models. Furthermore, this work will be extended to the water balance study of the whole Heihe River basin.},

Changes in the turbulent fluxes in this part of the turbulence spectrum were found to have a significant influence on the changes of the residual. Using the ogive method, it was found that the eddy-covariance method underestimates turbulent fluxes in the case of ogives converging for measuring times longer than the typical averaging interval of 30 min. Additionally, the eddy-covariance method underestimates turbulent fluxes for maximal ogive functions within the averaging interval, both mainly due to advection and non-steady state conditions. This has a considerable influence on the use of the eddy-covariance method.},

It will be shown that former assumptions that measuring errors or storage terms are the reason for the unclosed energy balance do not stand up because even turbulent fluxes derived from documented methods and calibrated sensors, net radiation, and ground heat fluxes cannot close the energy balance. Instead, exchange processes on larger scales of the heterogeneous landscape have a significant influence. By including these fluxes, the energy balance can be approximately closed. Therefore, the problem is a scale problem and has important consequences to the measurement and modeling of turbulent fluxes.},

These issues include inadvertent conversion of random errors to systematic errors, ambiguous differentiation between turbulence and other motions, and omission of transport by stationary eddies. Correcting for sonic misalignment and flow distortion in the presence of real systematic vertical motions is also problematic. Special emphasis is placed on the need for spatial information, partly to include vertical transport by stationary circulations induced by small-scale surface features. While no categorical solutions to the above problems are offered, promising approaches worthy of more investigation are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the available energy (i.e., the net radiation minus the ground heat flux) is often 10{\textendash}30\% larger than the sum of turbulent fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance method. Although field observations and previous large-eddy simulation studies have shown that surface heterogeneity can induce flux imbalance, the relationship between the flux imbalance magnitude and the surface heterogeneity scale remains to be investigated in more detail. Here we examine the flux imbalance over landscapes characterized by different surface heterogeneity scales in a dry freely convective boundary layer. We reveal that the flux imbalance initially increases with increasing surface heterogeneity scale. However, when the surface heterogeneity scale becomes larger than the boundary layer height, the surface starts to behave locally homogeneous, which leads to a lower flux imbalance. Based on large-eddy simulation results, we propose a conceptual model to explain how the domain average flux imbalance is influenced by surface heterogeneity. The flux imbalance is found to be controlled by the ratio of the boundary layer height to the Obukhov length (-zi/L), the integral length scale of vertical velocity (lw), the mean horizontal speed (U), and the time averaging interval (T). Among these four variables, lw determines the size of turbulent coherent structures (i.e., large eddies), whereas -zi/L affects the form of these large eddies. Meanwhile, the U and T determine how many these large eddies can be sampled by the eddy covariance. This finding indicates that it may be possible to diagnose the flux imbalance using these four variables under convective conditions.},

	abstract = {While the increasing availability of computational power is enabling finer grid resolutions in numerical-weather-prediction models, representing land{\textendash}atmosphere exchange processes remains challenging. This partially results from the fact that land-surface heterogeneity exists at all spatial scales, and its variability does not necessarily {\textquoteleft}average{\textquoteright} out with decreasing size. The work presented here uses large-eddy simulations and the concept of dispersive fluxes to quantify the effects of a surface that is thermally inhomogeneous (with scales that are approximately 10\% of the height of the atmospheric boundary layer), but uniformly rough. These near-canonical cases describe inhomogeneous scalar transport over a broad range of unstable atmospheric flows. Results illustrate the existence of a regime where the mean flow is mostly driven by the surface thermal heterogeneities. In this regime, the contribution of the dispersive fluxes can account for more than 40\% of the total sensible heat flux at 100 m above the ground and about 5{\textendash}10\% near the surface. This result is independent of the spatial distribution of the thermal heterogeneities and weakly dependent on the averaging time used to define the dispersive fluxes. Additionally, an alternative regime exists where the effects of the surface thermal heterogeneities are quickly blended and the dispersive fluxes match those obtained over an equivalent homogeneous surface. Results further illustrate the existence of a new cospectral scaling for the dispersive sensible heat fluxes that differs from the traditional turbulence cospectral scaling. We believe that these results might elucidate pathways for developing new parametrizations for the non-canonical atmospheric surface layer.},

	abstract = {A study of low-speed streaks (LSSs) embedded in the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer is performed using selective visualization and analysis of time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomo-PIV). First, a three-dimensional velocity field database is acquired using time-resolved tomo-PIV for an early turbulent boundary layer. Second, detailed time-line flow patterns are obtained from the low-order reconstructed database using {\textquoteleft}tomographic visualizations{\textquoteright} by Lagrangian tracking. These time-line patterns compare remarkably well with previously observed patterns using hydrogen bubble flow visualization, and allow local identification of LSSs within the database. Third, the flow behaviour in proximity to selected LSSs is examined at varying wall distances (10 {\textless} y+ {\textless} 100) and assessed using time-line and material surface evolution, to reveal the flow structure and evolution of a streak, and the flow structure evolving from streak development. It is observed that three-dimensional wave behaviour of the detected LSSs appears to develop into associated near-wall vortex flow structures, in a process somewhat similar to transitional boundary layer behaviour. Fourth, the presence of Lagrangian coherent structures is assessed in proximity to the LSSs using a Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation process. It is observed that quasi-streamwise vortices, adjacent to the sides of the streak-associated three-dimensional wave, precipitate an interaction with the streak. Finally, a hypothesis based on the behaviour of soliton-like coherent structures is made which explains the process of LSS formation, bursting behaviour and the generation of hairpin vortices. Comparison with other models is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A broad-scale circulation index representing the interannual variability of the Indian summer monsoon is proposed and is shown to be well correlated with the interannual variability of precipitation in the Indian monsoon region. Using monthly precipitation analysis based on merging rain-gauge data with satellite estimates of precipitation for the period 1979-96, it is shown that the variability of precipitation on seasonal to interannual time-scales is coherent over a large region covering the Indian continent as well as the north Bay of Bengal and parts of south China. A new index, termed Extended Indian Monsoon Rainfall (EIMR), is defined as the precipitation averaged over the region 70"E-110{\textdegree}E, lWN-30"N. The EIMR index is expected to represent the convective heating fluctuations associated with the Indian monsoon better than the traditional all India Monsoon Rainfall (IMR) based only on the precipitation over the Indian continent. It is shown that large precipitation over the Bay of Bengal with significant interannual variability cannot be ignored in the definition of Indian summer monsoon and its variability. The June-to-September climatological mean EIMR is found to be larger than that of the IMR even though the former is averaged over a larger area. The dominant mode of interannual variability of the Indian summer monsoon is associated with a dipole between the EIMR region and the north-westem Pacific region (110"E-16O0E, 1O"N-30"N) and a meridional dipole between the EIMR region and the equatorial Indian Ocean (70"E-11OoE, lWS-5"N).},

	abstract = {Numerous oceanic and atmospheric phenomena influence El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, complicating both prediction and analysis of the mechanisms responsible for generating ENSO diversity. Predictability of ENSO events depends on the characteristics of both the forecast initial conditions and the stochastic forcing that occurs subsequent to forecast initialization. Within a linear inverse model framework, stochastic forcing reduces ENSO predictability when it excites unpredictable growth or interference after the forecast is initialized, but also enhances ENSO predictability when it excites optimal initial conditions that maximize deterministic ENSO growth. Linear inverse modeling (LIM) allows for straightforward separation between predictable signal and unpredictable noise and so can diagnose its own skill. While previous LIM studies of ENSO focused on deterministic dynamics, here we explore how noise forcing influences ENSO diversity and predictability. This study identifies stochastic forcing details potentially contributing to the development of central Pacific (CP) or eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO characteristics. The technique is then used to diagnose the relative roles of initial conditions and noise forcing throughout the evolution of several ENSO events. LIM results show varying roles of noise forcing for any given event, highlighting its utility in separating deterministic from noise-forced contributions to the evolution of individual ENSO events. For example, the strong 1982 event was considerably more influenced by noise forcing late in its evolution than the strong 1997 event, which was more predictable with long lead times due to its deterministic growth. Furthermore, the 2014 deterministic trajectory suggests that a strong event in 2014 was unlikely.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new consistent way of parametrizing simultaneously local and non-local turbulent transport for the convective atmospheric boundary layer has been proposed and tested for the clear boundary layer. This approach assumes that in the convective boundary layer the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, that are parametrized by an eddy-diffusivity approach, and thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. Since the interaction between the cloud layer and the underlying sub-cloud layer predominantly takes place through strong updraughts, this approach offers an interesting avenue of establishing a unified description of the turbulent transport in the cumulus-topped boundary layer. This paper explores the possibility of such a new approach for the cumulus-topped boundary layer. In the sub-cloud and cloud layers, the mass-flux term represents the effect of strong updraughts. These are modelled by a simple entraining parcel, which determines the mean properties of the strong updraughts, the boundary-layer height, the lifting condensation level and cloud top. The residual smaller-scale turbulent transport is parametrized with an eddy-diffusivity approach that uses a turbulent kinetic energy closure. The new scheme is implemented and tested in the research model MesoNH.},

From the start, researchers drew from an ever-expanding set of disciplines{\textemdash}thermodynamics, soil and plant studies, fluid dynamics and turbulence, cloud microphysics, and aerosol studies. Research expanded upward to include the entire ABL in response to the need to know how particles and trace gases dispersed, and later how to represent the ABL in numerical models of weather and climate (starting in the 1970s{\textendash}80s); taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by the development of large-eddy simulations (1970s), direct numerical simulations (1990s), and a host of instruments to sample the boundary layer in situ and remotely from the surface, the air, and space. Near-surface flux-profile relationships were developed rapidly between the 1940s and 1970s, when rapid progress shifted to the fair-weather convective boundary layer (CBL), though tropical CBL studies date back to the 1940s. In the 1980s, ABL research began to include the interaction of the ABL with the surface and clouds, the first ABL parameterization schemes emerged; and land surface and ocean surface model development blossomed. Research in subsequent decades has focused on more complex ABLs, often identified by shortcomings or uncertainties in weather and climate models, including the stable boundary layer, the Arctic boundary layer, cloudy boundary layers, and ABLs over heterogeneous surfaces (including cities).

	abstract = {The atmospheric boundary layer is the level of the atmosphere where all human activities occur. It is a layer characterized by its turbulent flow state, meaning that the velocity, temperature and scalar concentrations fluctuate over scales that range from less than a millimetre to several kilometres. It is those fluctuations that make dispersion of pollutants and transport of heat, momentum as well as scalars such as carbon dioxide or cloud-condensation nuclei efficient. It is also the layer where a {\textquoteleft}hand-shake{\textquoteright} occurs between activities on the land surface and the climate system, primarily due to the action of large energetic swirling motions or eddies. The atmospheric boundary layer experiences dramatic transitions depending on whether the underlying surface is being heated or cooled. The existing paradigm describing the size and energetics of large-scale and very large-scale eddies in turbulent flows has been shaped by decades of experiments and simulations on smooth pipes and channels with no surface heating or cooling. The emerging picture, initiated by A. A. Townsend in 1951, is that large- and very large-scale motions appear to be approximated by a collection of hairpin-shaped vortices whose population density scales inversely with distance from the boundary. How does surface heating, quintessential to the atmospheric boundary layer, alter this canonical picture? What are the implications of such a buoyancy force on the geometry and energy distribution across velocity components in those large eddies? How do these large eddies modulate small eddies near the ground? Answering these questions and tracking their consequences to existing theories used today to describe the flow statistics in the atmospheric boundary layer are addressed in the work of Salesky \& Anderson (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 856, 2018, pp. 135{\textendash}168). The findings are both provocative and surprisingly simple.},

The degree of non-equilibrium of the turbulence is most reliably evaluated following the local flow rather than using the more available fixed-point measurements. We survey methods to eliminate non-stationary records or partially filter out the non-stationarity. We also summarize issues with parametrization of the non-stationarity. Non-stationarity over the sea can be complex due to time-dependent wave state and surface roughness. The impact of non-stationarity is generally less understood in the stable boundary layer compared to the unstable boundary layer.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The imbalance of the surface energy budget in eddy-covariance
measurements is still an unsolved problem. A possible cause is the presence
of land surface heterogeneity, which affects the boundary-layer turbulence.
To investigate the impact of surface variables on the partitioning of the
energy budget of flux measurements in the surface layer under convective
conditions, we set up a systematic parameter study by means of large-eddy
simulation. For the study we use a virtual control volume approach, which
allows the determination of advection by the mean flow, flux-divergence and
storage terms of the energy budget at the virtual measurement site, in
addition to the standard turbulent flux. We focus on the heterogeneity of the
surface fluxes and keep the topography flat. The surface fluxes vary locally
in intensity and these patches have different length scales. Intensity and
length scales can vary for the two horizontal dimensions but follow an
idealized chessboard pattern. Our main focus lies on surface heterogeneity of
the kilometer scale, and one order of magnitude smaller. For these two length
scales, we investigate the average response of the fluxes at a number of
virtual towers, when varying the heterogeneity length within the length scale
and when varying the contrast between the different patches. For each
simulation, virtual measurement towers were positioned at functionally
different positions (e.g., downdraft region, updraft region, at border
between domains, etc.). As the storage term is always small, the non-closure
is given by the sum of the advection by the mean flow and the
flux-divergence. Remarkably, the missing flux can be described by either the
advection by the mean flow or the flux-divergence separately, because the
latter two have a high correlation with each other. For kilometer scale
heterogeneity, we notice a clear dependence of the updrafts and downdrafts on
the surface heterogeneity and likewise we also see a dependence of the energy
partitioning on the tower location. For the hectometer scale, we do not
notice such a clear dependence. Finally, we seek correlators for the energy
balance ratio in the simulations. The correlation with the friction velocity
is less pronounced than previously found, but this is likely due to our
concentration on effectively strongly to freely convective conditions.},

	abstract = {Single-tower eddy-covariance measurements represent the complete surface flux of a scalar only under idealized conditions. Therefore, we often find an underestimation of energy fluxes expressed as a lack of energy balance closure at many sites. In this study, a multi-tower approach to measure atmospheric energy fluxes based on spatial averaging is evaluated and possible mechanisms causing a lack of energy balance closure are analysed, focussing on daytime data only. It is shown that the multi-tower technique is also unable to measure the entire flux for our site, likely because the assumption of horizontal homogeneity is violated. Heterogeneity-induced and buoyancy-driven quasi-stationary circulations are probably the dominant processes causing the underestimation of energy fluxes. A dependence of the energy balance residual on stability is found, with residuals close to zero for stable stratification, a maximum under unstable to near-neutral conditions and still relatively large residuals for stronger instability. Assuming the processes transporting energy and CO2 are similar, the implications on long-term CO2 flux measurements are analysed. Accordingly, the resulting selective systematic error of cumulative net ecosystem exchange estimates for agricultural regions such as ours can be of the order of more than 100\%, since mainly the fluxes during periods of net CO2 uptake are underestimated while periods of net CO2 release are much less affected by this bias. Further investigations about this issue are highly warranted.},

It has been reported that such roughness induces a spanwise-wall normal mean secondary flow in the form of mean streamwise vorticity associated with counter-rotating boundary-layer-scale circulations. Here, we demonstrate that this mean secondary flow is Prandtl{\textquoteright}s secondary flow of the second kind, both driven and sustained by spatial gradients in the Reynolds-stress components, which cause a subsequent imbalance between production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy that necessitates secondary advective velocities. In reaching this conclusion, we study (i) secondary circulations due to spatial gradients of turbulent kinetic energy, and (ii) the production budgets of mean streamwise vorticity by gradients of the Reynolds stresses. We attribute the secondary flow phenomena to extreme peaks of surface stress on the relatively high-roughness regions and associated elevated turbulence production in the fluid immediately above. An optimized state is attained by entrainment of fluid exhibiting the lowest turbulent stresses {\textendash} from above {\textendash} and subsequent lateral ejection in order to preserve conservation of mass.},

Although field observations and previous large-eddy simulation studies have shown that surface heterogeneity can induce flux imbalance, the relationship between the flux imbalance magnitude and the surface heterogeneity scale remains to be investigated in more detail. Here we examine the flux imbalance over landscapes characterized by different surface heterogeneity scales in a dry freely convective boundary layer. We reveal that the flux imbalance initially increases with increasing surface heterogeneity scale. However, when the surface heterogeneity scale becomes larger than the boundary layer height, the surface starts to behave locally homogeneous, which leads to a lower flux imbalance. Based on large-eddy simulation results, we propose a conceptual model to explain how the domain average flux imbalance is influenced by surface heterogeneity. The flux imbalance is found to be controlled by the ratio of the boundary layer height to the Obukhov length (-zi/L), the integral length scale of vertical velocity (lw), the mean horizontal speed (U), and the time averaging interval (T). Among these four variables, lw determines the size of turbulent coherent structures (i.e., large eddies), whereas -zi/L affects the form of these large eddies. Meanwhile, the U and T determine how many these large eddies can be sampled by the eddy covariance. This finding indicates that it may be possible to diagnose the flux imbalance using these four variables under convective conditions.},

Here data collected from an EC tower over a semiarid sagebrush ecosystem indicate that under unstable atmospheric conditions, the nonclosure becomes increased with increasing instability, consistent with many other studies. It is demonstrated that the increased nonclosure is not caused by the inadequate sampling of large-scale turbulent motions using a 30-min averaging interval, though the scales of turbulent motions dominating sensible and latent heat fluxes become enlarged with increasing instability. Quadrant analysis is then used to reveal that the flux contributions from ejections remain nearly constant with increasing instability, whereas the flux contributions from sweeps are reduced and their time fractions increase. Our results imply that the increased nonclosure of surface energy balance is associated with changes in turbulent structures including their dominant time scales and flux contributions of ejections and sweeps as the atmospheric instability increases, which require further studies using vertically distributed observations and/or large eddy simulations.},

	abstract = {The Evaporation at Grid/Pixel Scale (EVA\_GRIPS) project was realised in order to determine the area-averaged evaporation over a heterogeneous land surface at the scale of a grid box of a regional numerical weather prediction or climate model, and at the scale of a pixel of a satellite image. EVA\_GRIPS combined surface-based and airborne measurements, satellite data analysis, and numerical modelling activities. A mesoscale field experiment, LITFASS-2003, was carried out in the heterogeneous landscape around the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg (MOL) of the German Meteorological Service in May and June, 2003. The experiment was embedded in the comprehensive, operational measurement program of the MOL. Experimental determination of surface fluxes on a variety of spatial scales was achieved by employing micrometeorological flux stations, scintillometers, a combination of ground-based remote sensing instruments, and the Helipod, a turbulence probe carried by a helicopter. Surface energy fluxes were also derived from satellite data. Modelling work included the use of different Soil{\textendash}Vegetation{\textendash}Atmosphere Transfer schemes, a large-eddy simulation model and three mesoscale atmospheric models. The paper gives an overview on the background of EVA\_GRIPS, and on the measurements and meteorological conditions during LITFASS-2003. A few general results are discussed.},

However, under large surface heat fluxes and weak to negligible shear, convection tends to organize into open cells, similar to turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection. Using a suite of 14 large-eddy simulations (LES) spanning a range of -zi /L between zero (neutral) and 1041 (highly convective), where zi is the CBL depth and L is the Obukhov length, the transition between roll- and cellular-type convection is investigated systematically for the first time using LES. Mean vertical profiles including velocity variances and turbulent transport efficiencies, as well the {\textquotedblleft}roll factor,{\textquotedblright} which characterizes the rotational symmetry of the vertical velocity field, indicate the transition occurs gradually over a range of -zi /L; however, the most significant changes in vertical profiles and CBL organization occur from near-neutral conditions up to about -zi /L ? 15{\textendash}20. Turbulent transport efficiencies and quadrant analysis are used to characterize the turbulent transport of momentum and heat with increasing -zi /L. It is found that turbulence transports heat efficiently from weakly to highly convective conditions; however, turbulent momentum transport becomes increasingly inefficient as -zi /L increases.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric stability effects on the dissimilarity between the turbulent transport of momentum and scalars (water vapour and temperature) are investigated in the neutral and unstable atmospheric surface layers over a lake and a vineyard. A decorrelation of the momentum and scalar fluxes is observed with increasing instability. Moreover, different measures of transport efficiency (correlation coefficients, efficiencies based on quadrant analysis and bulk transfer coefficients) indicate that, under close to neutral conditions, momentum and scalars are transported similarly whereas, as the instability of the atmosphere increases, scalars are transported increasingly more efficiently than momentum. This dissimilarity between the turbulent transport of momentum and scalars under unstable conditions concurs with, and is likely caused by, a change in the topology of turbulent coherent structures. Previous laboratory and field studies report that under neutral conditions hairpin vortices and hairpin packets are present and dominate the vertical fluxes, while under free-convection conditions thermal plumes are expected. Our results (cross-stream vorticity variation, quadrant analysis and time series analysis) are in very good agreement with this picture and confirm a change in the structure of the coherent turbulent motions under increasing instability, although the exact structure of these motions and how they are modified by stability requires further investigation based on three-dimensional flow data.},

The design and implementation of a new multilevel canopy model is presented. Instantaneous fields from the simulations show that organized motions on the scale of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) depth bring high momentum down to canopy top, locally modulating the vertical shear of the horizontal wind. The evolution of these ABL-scale structures with increasing instability and their impact on vertical profiles of turbulence moments and integral length scales within and above the canopy are discussed. Linkages between atmospheric turbulence and biological control impact horizontal scalar source distributions. Decreasing spatial correlation between momentum and scalar fluxes with increasing instability results from ABL-scale structures spatially segregating momentum and scalar exchange at canopy top. In combination, these results suggest the need for roughness sublayer parameterizations to incorporate an additional length or time scale reflecting the influence of ABL-scale organized motions.},

	abstract = {This manuscript describes numerical experiments investigating the influence of 2{\textendash}30-km striplike heterogeneity on wet and dry convective boundary layers coupled to the land surface. The striplike heterogeneity is shown to dramatically alter the structure of the convective boundary layer by inducing significant organized circulations that modify turbulent statistics. The impact, strength, and extent of the organized motions depend critically on the scale of the heterogeneity ? relative to the boundary layer height zi. The coupling with the land surface modifies the surface fluxes and hence the circulations resulting in some differences compared to previous studies using fixed surface forcing. Because of the coupling, surface fluxes in the middle of the patches are small compared to the patch edges. At large heterogeneity scales (?/zi ?18) horizontal surface-flux gradients within each patch are strong enough to counter the surface-flux gradients between wet and dry patches allowing the formation of small cells within the patch coexisting with the large-scale patch-induced circulations. The strongest patch-induced motions occur in cases with 4 ? ?/zi ? 9 because of strong horizontal pressure gradients across the wet and dry patches. Total boundary layer turbulence kinetic energy increases significantly for surface heterogeneity at scales between ?/zi ? 4 and 9; however, entrainment rates for all cases are largely unaffected by the striplike heterogeneity.},

This sampling rate is not adequate to compute turbulent pressure fluxes with the classic averaging method, but the wavelet transform allows flux estimations at a wide range of scales. The resolution of the devices is suitable to study pressure perturbations such as internal gravity waves. The night period of the Intensive Operational Period number 6 (IOP6), where wave-like structures were present, is chosen to illustrate the method. A complete wavelet analysis of pressure records and data from sonic anemometers located at the same heights in the tower is performed. Wavelet methods make it possible to identify the relevant scales in the flow and to study the vertical structure of pressure perturbations, including coherent structures and smallscale motions. A study of a simplified turbulence kinetic energy budget equation is made and the contribution of the pressure terms is discussed.},

The dissimilarity of scalar transport in the lower convective boundary layer is quantified in several ways: eddy diffusivity, spatial structure of the scalar fields, and spatial and temporal variations in the surface fluxes of these scalars. The results show that eddy diffusivities differ among the three scalars, by up to 10{\textendash}12\%, in the surface layer; the difference is partly attributed to the influence of top-down diffusion. The turbulence-organized structures of CO2 bear more resemblance to those of water vapour than those of the potential temperature. The surface fluxes when coupled with the flow aloft show large spatial variations even with perfectly homogeneous surface conditions and constant solar radiation forcing across the horizontal simulation domain. In general, the surface sensible heat flux shows the greatest spatial and temporal variations, and the CO2 flux the least. Furthermore, our results show that the one-dimensional land-surface model scheme underestimates the surface heat flux by 3{\textendash}8\% and overestimates the water vapour and CO2 fluxes by 2{\textendash}8\% and 1{\textendash}9\%, respectively, as compared to the flux simulated with the coupled LES-LSM.},

	abstract = {An understanding of how the convective boundary layer (CBL) is mixed under heterogeneous surface forcing is crucial for the interpretation of area-averaged turbulence measurements. To determine the height and degree to which a complex heterogeneous surface affects the CBL, large-eddy simulations (LES) for two days of the LITFASS-2003 experiment representing two different wind regimes were undertaken. Spatially-lagged correlation analysis revealed the turbulent heat fluxes to be dependent on the prescribed surface flux pattern throughout the entire CBL including the entrainment layer. These findings prompted the question of whether signals induced by surface heterogeneity can be measured by airborne systems. To examine this question, an ensemble of virtual flights was conducted using LES, according to Helipod flight measurements made during LITFASS-2003. The resulting ensemble-averaged heat fluxes indicated a clear dependence on the underlying surface up to the top of the CBL. However, a large scatter between the flux measurements in different ensemble runs was observed, which was the result of insufficient sampling of the largest turbulent eddies. The random and systematic errors based on the integral length scale did not indicate such a large scatter. For the given flight leg lengths, at least 10{\textendash}15 statistically independent flight measurements were necessary to give a significant estimate of heterogeneity-induced signals in the CBL. The need for ensemble averaging suggests that the observed blending of heterogeneity-induced signals in the CBL can be partly attributed to insufficient averaging.},

Edge effects are observed in the rapid variation of a number of budget terms across this vegetation transition. The enhanced drag force at the forest edge is largely balanced by the pressure gradient force and by streamwise advection of upstream momentum, while vertical turbulent diffusion is relatively insignificant. For variance and TKE budgets, the most important processes at the forest edge are production due to the convergence (or divergence) of the mean flow, streamwise advection, pressure diffusion and enhanced dissipation by canopy drag. Turbulent diffusion, pressure redistribution and vertical shear production, which are characteristic processes in homogeneous canopy flow, are less important at the forest transition. We demonstrate that, in the equilibrated canopy flow, a substantial amount of TKE produced in the streamwise direction by the vertical shear of the mean flow is redistributed in the vertical direction by pressure fluctuations. This redistribution process occurs in the upper canopy layers. Part of the TKE in the vertical velocity component is transferred by turbulent and pressure diffusion to the lower canopy levels, where pressure redistribution takes place again and feeds TKE back to the streamwise direction. In this TKE cycle, the primary source terms are vertical shear production for streamwise velocity variance and pressure redistribution for vertical velocity variance. The evolution of these primary source terms downwind of the forest edge largely controls the adjustment rates of velocity variances.},

It has been reported that such roughness induces a spanwise-wall normal mean secondary flow in the form of mean streamwise vorticity associated with counter-rotating boundary-layer-scale circulations. Here, we demonstrate that this mean secondary flow is Prandtl{\textquoteright}s secondary flow of the second kind, both driven and sustained by spatial gradients in the Reynolds-stress components, which cause a subsequent imbalance between production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy that necessitates secondary advective velocities. In reaching this conclusion, we study (i) secondary circulations due to spatial gradients of turbulent kinetic energy, and (ii) the production budgets of mean streamwise vorticity by gradients of the Reynolds stresses. We attribute the secondary flow phenomena to extreme peaks of surface stress on the relatively high-roughness regions and associated elevated turbulence production in the fluid immediately above. An optimized state is attained by entrainment of fluid exhibiting the lowest turbulent stresses {\textendash} from above {\textendash} and subsequent lateral ejection in order to preserve conservation of mass.},

The model eliminates most of the assumptions invoked in theories of cloud-capped mixed layers, but suffers disadvantages which include poor resolution and large truncation errors in and above the capping inversion. For relatively thick mixed layers with relatively thick capping inversions, the cloud-top radiative cooling is found to be lodged mostly within the capping inversion when the cooling is confined locally to the upper 50 m or less of the cloud. It does not then contribute substantially towards increased buoyancy flux and turbulence within the well mixed layer just below. The optimal means of correlating the entrainment rate, or mixed-layer growth rate, for mixed layers of variable amounts of stratocumulus is found to be through functional dependence upon an overall jump Richardson number, utilizing as scaling velocity the standard deviation of vertical velocity existing at the top of the mixed layer (near the center of the capping inversion). This velocity is found to be a fraction of the generalized convective velocity for the mixed layer as a whole which is greater for cloud-capped mixed layers than for clear mixed layers.},

	abstract = {Aeolian erosion of flat, arid landscapes is induced (and sustained) by the aerodynamic surface stress imposed by flow in the atmospheric surface layer. Conceptual models typically indicate that sediment mass flux, Q (via saltation or drift), scales with imposed aerodynamic stress raised to some exponent, n, where n {\textgreater} 1. This scaling demonstrates the importance of turbulent fluctuations in driving aeolian processes. In order to illustrate the importance of surface-stress intermittency in aeolian processes, and to elucidate the role of turbulence, conditional averaging predicated on aerodynamic surface stress has been used within large-eddy simulation of atmospheric boundary-layer flow over an arid, flat landscape. The conditional-sampling thresholds are defined based on probability distribution functions of surface stress. The simulations have been performed for a computational domain with ? 25H streamwise extent, where H is the prescribed depth of the neutrally-stratified boundary layer. Thus, the full hierarchy of spatial scales are captured, from surface-layer turbulence to large- and very-large-scale outer-layer coherent motions. Spectrograms are used to support this argument, and also to illustrate how turbulent energy is distributed across wavelengths with elevation. Conditional averaging provides an ensemble-mean visualization of flow structures responsible for erosion {\textquoteleft}events{\textquoteright}. Results indicate that surface-stress peaks are associated with the passage of inclined, high-momentum regions flanked by adjacent low-momentum regions. Fluid in the interfacial shear layers between these adjacent quasi-uniform momentum regions exhibits high streamwise and vertical vorticity.},

The model approach uses stochastic backward trajectories of particles and satisfies the well-mixed condition in inhomogeneous turbulence for continuous transitions from stable to convective stratification. We introduce a spin-up procedure of the model and a statistical treatment of particle touchdowns which leads to a significant reduction of CPU time compared to conventional footprint modelling approaches. A comparison with other footprint models (of the analytical and Lagrangian type) suggests that the present backward Lagrangian model provides valid footprint predictions under any stratification and, moreover, for applications that reach across different similarity scaling domains (e.g., surface layer to mixed layer, for use in connection with aircraft measurements or with observations on high towers).},

These footprint estimates strongly vary in size, depending on receptor height, atmospheric stability, and surface roughness. Reliable footprint calculations from, e.g., Lagrangian stochastic models or large-eddy simulations are computationally expensive and cannot readily be computed for long-term observational programs. To facilitate more accessible footprint estimates, a scaling procedure is introduced for flux footprint functions over a range of stratifications from convective to stable, and receptor heights ranging from near the surface to the middle of the boundary layer. It is shown that, when applying this scaling procedure, footprint estimates collapse to an ensemble of similar curves. A simple parameterisation for the scaled footprint estimates is presented. This parameterisation accounts for the influence of the roughness length on the footprint and allows for a quick but precise algebraic footprint estimation.},

            Urbanization modifies atmospheric energy and moisture balances, forming distinct features [e.g., urban heat islands (UHIs) and enhanced or decreased precipitation].

The Study of Urban Impacts on Rainfall and Fog/Haze (SURF) has brought together international expertise on observations and modeling, meteorology and atmospheric chemistry, and research and operational forecasting. The SURF overall science objective is a better understanding of urban, terrain, convection, and aerosol interactions for improved forecast accuracy. Specific objectives include a) promoting cooperative international research to improve understanding of urban summer convective precipitation and winter particulate episodes via extensive field studies, b) improving high-resolution urban weather and air quality forecast models, and c) enhancing urban weather forecasts for societal applications (e.g., health, energy, hydrologic, climate change, air quality, planning, and emergency response management). Preliminary SURF observational and modeling results are shown (i.e., turbulent PBL structure, bifurcating thunderstorms, haze events, urban canopy model development, and model forecast evaluation).},

            Large-scale circulations around a city are co-modulated by the urban heat island and by regional wind patterns. Depending on these variables, the circulations fall into different regimes ranging from advection-dominated (plume regime) to convection-driven (bubble regime). Using dimensional analysis and large-eddy simulations, this study investigates how these different circulations scale with urban and rural heat fluxes, as well as upstream wind speed. Two dimensionless parameters are shown to control the dynamics of the flow: (1)~the ratio of rural to urban thermal convective velocities that contrasts their respective buoyancy fluxes and (2)~the ratio of bulk inflow velocity to the convection velocity in the rural area. Finally, the vertical flow velocities transecting the rural to urban transitions are used to develop a criterion for categorizing different large-scale circulations into plume, bubble or transitional regimes. The findings have implications for city ventilation since bubble regimes are expected to trap pollutants, as well as for scaling analysis in canonical mixed-convection flows.},

In order to simulate the stable planetary boundary layer, we developed a modified version of the two-part subgrid-scale model of Sullivan et al. This improved version of the model is used to simulate a highly cooled yet fairly windy stable boundary layer with a surface heat flux of w$\theta$ o = -0.05 m K s-1 and a geostrophic wind speed of Ug = 15 m s-1. Flow visualization and evaluation of the turbulence statistics from this case reveal the development of a continuously turbulent boundary layer with small-scale structures. The stability of the boundary layer coupled with the presence of a strong capping inversion results in the development of a dominant gravity wave at the top of the stable boundary layer that appears to be related to the most unstable wave predicted by the Taylor{\textendash}Goldstein equation. As a result of the decay of turbulence aloft, a strong-low level jet forms above the boundary layer. The time dependent behaviour of the jet is compared with Blackadar{\textquoteright}s inertial oscillation analysis.},

	abstract = {One aim of past boundary-layer experiments with aircraft was the determination of areally averaged heat fluxes. In spite of sophisticated instrumentation the measured fluxes extrapolated to the ground differed significantly from fluxes measured directly at ground stations. This study presents simulated sensible heat flux measurements with aircraft flights through a synthetic convective boundary layer created by a 401 {\texttimes} 401 {\texttimes} 42 cubic-grid large eddy simulation (LES) with a grid spacing of 50 m. After some considerations with respect to necessary measurement lengths using results of Lenschow and Stankov (1986 {\textendash} J. Atmos. Sci. 43, 1198{\textendash}1209), simulated measurement campaigns were carried out in three model runs. During each model run five sets of measurement runs were carried out successively. During each set of runs 10 aircraft flew at 10 altitudes with a ground speed of 100 m s-1 simultaneously through time and space. In total, 150 legs were carried out, 15 at each flight level. The resulting {\textquoteleft}measured{\textquoteright} heat fluxes were compared with those of the {\textquoteleft}true{\textquoteright} flux profiles obtained directly from the ensemble-averaged LES-generated data. No significant systematic error between {\textquoteleft}measured{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}true{\textquoteright} profiles was observed. Furthermore, the comparison of the resulting relative error with the theory of Lenschow and Stankov showed a good agreement at all measurement levels.},

In particular the efficiency of the turbulent exchange of sensible and latent heat is observed to be more strongly enhanced than is consistent with the standard model. Also the profiles of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and temperature fluctuation variance are found to depend on the structure of the whole boundary layer (i.e. are non-local), indicating that a large-scale transport process is at work. At the same time, co-spectral analysis shows how the large-scale eddy motions that determine the heat transport process near the surface are typically 1/5 of the surface layer depth. All these features are found to be similar in measurements at a marine site and at a flat land site, indicating that they are determined by the dynamics of the whole boundary layer rather than being simply dependent on the surface boundary conditions.},

High-resolution largeeddy simulations of a realistic diurnal cycle with an embedded wind farm are performed. Simulations are forced by a constant geostrophic velocity with time-varying surface boundary conditions derived from a selected period of the CASES-99 field campaign. Through analysis of the bulk statistics of the flow as a function of height and time, it is shown that extensive wind farms shift the inertial oscillations and the associated nocturnal low-level jet vertically upwards by approximately 200 m; cause a three times stronger stratification between the surface and the rotor-disk region, and as a consequence, delay the formation and growth of the convective boundary layer (CBL) by approximately 2 h. These perturbations are shown to have a direct impact on the potential power output of an extensive wind farm with the displacement of the low-level jet causing lower power output during the night as compared to the day. The low-power regime at night is shown to persist for almost 2 h beyond the morning transition due to the reduced growth of the CBL. It is shown that the wind farm induces a deeper entrainment region with greater entrainment fluxes. Finally, it is found that the diurnally-averaged effective roughness length for wind farms is much lower than the reference value computed theoretically for neutral conditions.},

	abstract = {Independent measurements of the major energy balance flux components are not often consistent with the principle of conservation of energy. This is referred to as a lack of closure of the surface energy balance. Most results in the literature have shown the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes measured by eddy covariance to be less than the difference between net radiation and soil heat fluxes. This under-measurement of sensible and latent heat fluxes by eddy-covariance instruments has occurred in numerous field experiments and among many different manufacturers of instruments. Four eddy-covariance systems consisting of the same models of instruments were set up side-by-side during the Southern Great Plains 1997 Hydrology Experiment and all systems under-measured fluxes by similar amounts. One of these eddy-covariance systems was collocated with three other types of eddy-covariance systems at different sites; all of these systems under-measured the sensible and latent-heat fluxes. The net radiometers and soil heat flux plates used in conjunction with the eddy-covariance systems were calibrated independently and measurements of net radiation and soil heat flux showed little scatter for various sites. The 10\% absolute uncertainty in available energy measurements was considerably smaller than the systematic closure problem in the surface energy budget, which varied from 10 to 30\%. When available-energy measurement errors are known and modest, eddy-covariance measurements of sensible and latent heat fluxes should be adjusted for closure. Although the preferred method of energy balance closure is to maintain the Bowen{\textendash}ratio, the method for obtaining closure appears to be less important than assuring that eddy-covariance measurements are consistent with conservation of energy. Based on numerous measurements over a sorghum canopy, carbon dioxide fluxes, which are measured by eddy covariance, are underestimated by the same factor as eddy covariance evaporation measurements when energy balance closure is not achieved.

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations were performed of a neutrally-stratified turbulent flow within and above an ideal, horizontally- and vertically-homogeneous plant canopy. Three simulations were performed for shear-driven flows in small and large computational domains, and a pressure-driven flow in a small domain, to enable the nature of canopy turbulence unaffected by external conditions to be captured. The simulations reproduced quite realistic canopy turbulence characteristics, including typical ramp structures appearing in time traces of the scalar concentration near the canopy top. Then, the spatial structure of the organised turbulence that caused the scalar ramps was examined using conditional sampling of three-dimensional instantaneous fields, triggered by the occurrence of ramp structures. A wavelet transform was used for the detection of ramp structures in the time traces. The ensemble-averaged results illustrate that the scalar ramps are associated with the microfrontal structure in the scalar, the ejection-sweep structure in the streamwise and vertical velocities, a laterally divergent flow just around the ramp-detection point, and a positive, vertically-coherent pressure perturbation. These vertical structures were consistent with previous measurements made in fields or wind tunnels. However, the most striking feature is that the horizontal slice of the same structure revealed a streamwise-elongated region of high-speed streamwise velocity impacting on another elongated region of low-speed velocity. These elongated structures resemble the so-called streak structures that are commonly observed in near-wall shear layers. Since elongated structures of essentially similar spatial scales were observed in all of the runs, these streak structures appear to be inherent in near-canopy turbulence. Presumably, strong wind shear formed just above the canopy is involved in their formation. By synthesis of the ensemble-averaged and instantaneous results, the following processes were inferred for the development of scalar microfronts and their associated flow structures: (1) a distinct scalar microfront develops where a coherent downdraft associated with a high-speed streak penetrates into the region of a low-speed streak; (2) a stagnation in flow between two streaks of different velocities builds up a vertically-coherent high-pressure region there; (3) the pressure gradients around the high-pressure region work to reduce the longitudinal variations in streamwise velocity and to enhance the laterally-divergent flow and lifted updrafts downstream of the microfront; (4) as the coherent mother downdraft impinges on the canopy, canopy-scale eddies are formed near the canopy top in a similar manner as observed in conventional mixing-layer turbulence.},

	abstract = {Abstract A detailed analysis of second-order moment budgets for cloud topped boundary layers (CTBLs) is performed using high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES). Two CTBLs are simulated{\textemdash}one with trade wind shallow cumuli, and the other with nocturnal marine stratocumuli. Approximations to the ensemble-mean budgets of the Reynolds-stress components, of the fluxes of two quasi-conservative scalars, and of the scalar variances and covariance are computed by averaging the LES data over horizontal planes and over several hundred time steps. Importantly, the subgrid scale contributions to the budget terms are accounted for. Analysis of the LES-based second-moment budgets reveals, among other things, a paramount importance of the pressure scrambling terms in the Reynolds-stress and scalar-flux budgets. The pressure-strain correlation tends to evenly redistribute kinetic energy between the components, leading to the growth of horizontal-velocity variances at the expense of the vertical-velocity variance which is produced by buoyancy over most of both CTBLs. The pressure gradient-scalar covariances are the major sink terms in the budgets of scalar fluxes. The third-order transport proves to be of secondary importance in the scalar-flux budgets. However, it plays a key role in maintaining budgets of TKE and of the scalar variances and covariance. Results from the second-moment budget analysis suggest that the accuracy of description of the CTBL structure within the second-order closure framework strongly depends on the fidelity of parameterizations of the pressure scrambling terms in the flux budgets and of the third-order transport terms in the variance budgets.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation provides a physically sound approach to study complex turbulent processes within the atmospheric boundary layer including urban boundary layer flows. However, such flow problems often involve a large separation of turbulent scales, requiring a large computational domain and very high grid resolution near the surface features, leading to prohibitive 5 computational costs. To overcome this problem, an online LES-LES nesting scheme is implemented into the PALM model system 6.0. The hereby documented and evaluated nesting method is capable of supporting multiple child domains which can be nested within their parent domain either in a parallel or recursively cascading configuration. The nesting system is evaluated by simulating first a purely convective boundary layer flow system and then three different neutrally-stratified flow scenarios with increasing order of topographic complexity. The results of the nested runs are compared with corresponding non10 nested high- and low-resolution results. The results reveal that the solution accuracy within the high-resolution nest domain is clearly improved as the solutions approach the non-nested high-resolution reference results. In obstacle-resolving LES, the two-way coupling becomes problematic as anterpolation introduces a regional discrepancy within the obstacle canopy of the parent domain. This is remedied by introducing canopy-restricted anterpolation where the operation is only performed above the obstacle canopy. The test simulations make evident that this approach is the most suitable coupling strategy for 15 obstacle-resolving LES. The performed simulations testify that nesting can reduce the CPU time up to 80\% compared to the fine-resolution reference runs while the computational overhead from the nesting operations remained below 16\% for the two-way coupling approach and significantly less for the one-way alternative.},

For this, two consecutive clear-sky days are simulated and the components of surface energy balance, as well as near-surface potential temperature, humidity and horizontal wind speed are compared against observation data. For the simulated period, components of the energy balance agree well during day- and nighttime, and also the daytime 5 Bowen ratio agrees fairly well compared to the observations. Although the model simulates a significantly more stably-stratified nocturnal boundary layer compared to the observation, near-surface potential temperature and humidity agree fairly well during day. Moreover, we performed a sensitivity study in order to investigate how much the model results depend on land-surface and soil specifications, as well as atmospheric initial conditions. By this, we find that a false estimation of the leaf area index, the albedo, or the initial humidity causes a serious misrepresentation of the daytime turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes. 10 During night, the boundary-layer characteristics are mostly affected by grid size, surface roughness, and the applied radiation schemes.},

	abstract = {The role of land-atmosphere interactions under heterogeneous surface conditions is investigated in order to identify mechanisms responsible for altering surface heat and moisture fluxes. Twelve coupled land surface {\textendash} large eddy simulation scenarios with four different length scales of surface variability under three different horizontal wind speeds are used in the analysis. The base case uses Landsat ETM imagery over the Cloud Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC) field site for 3 June 2007. Using wavelets, the surface fields are band-pass filtered in order to maintain the spatial mean and variances to length scales of 200 m, 1600 m, and 12.8 km as lower boundary conditions to the model (approximately 0.25, 1.2 and 9.5 times boundary layer height). The simulations exhibit little variation in net radiation. Rather, there is a pronounced change in the partitioning of the surface energy between sensible and latent heat flux. The sensible heat flux is dominant for intermediate surface length scales. For smaller and larger scales of surface heterogeneity, which can be viewed as being more homogeneous, the latent heat flux becomes increasingly important. The simulations showed approximately 50 Wm-2 difference in the spatially averaged latent heat flux. The results reflect a general decrease of the Bowen ratio as the surface conditions transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous. Air temperature is less sensitive to variations in surface heterogeneity than water vapor, which implies that the role of surface heterogeneity may be to maximize convective heat fluxes through modifying and maintaining local temperature gradients. More homogeneous surface conditions (i.e. smaller length scales), on the other hand, tend to maximize latent heat flux. The intermediate scale (1600 m) this does not hold, and is a more complicated interaction of scales.},

Unfortunately, the weighted mean has no analytical analog of the standard error of the arithmetic mean for use in characterizing its statistical uncertainty. Several approximate expressions have been used previously in the literature, but there is no consensus as to which is best. This paper compares three methods from the literature with a standard based on bootstrapping. Comparative calculations were carried out for nine major ions measured at 222 sampling sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The ratio variance approximation of Cochran (1977) gave results that were not statistically different from those of bootstrap ping, and is suggested as the method of choice for routine computing of the standard error of the weighted mean. The bootstrap method has advantages of its own, including the fact that it is nonparametric, but requires additional effort and computation time.},

We show that the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (3-month period) passed the thermal maximum for photosynthesis during the past decade. At higher temperatures, respiration rates continue to rise in contrast to sharply declining rates of photosynthesis. Under business-as-usual emissions, this divergence elicits a near halving of the land sink strength by as early as 2040.},

It offers the possibility to bridge the scale gap between local- and global-scale measurements by ground-based sites and remote-sensing instrumentations, and to validate the surface fluxes estimated by satellite products or process-based models. In this study, we developed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based EC system that can be operated to measure the turbulent fluxes in carbon dioxides, momentum, latent and sensible heat, as well as net radiation and photosynthetically active radiation. Flight tests of the developed UAV-based EC system over land were conducted in October 2020 in Inner Mongolia, China. The in-flight calibration was firstly conducted to correct the mounting error. Then, three flight comparison tests were performed, and we compared the measurement with those from a ground tower. The results, along with power spectral comparison and consideration of the differing measurement strategies indicate that the system can resolve the turbulent fluxes in the encountered measurement condition. Lastly, the challenges of the UAV-based EC method were discussed, and potential improvements with further development were explored. The results of this paper reveal the considerable potential of the UAV-based EC method for land surface process studies.},

	abstract = {The PALM 6.0 model system has been rapidly developed in the recent years with respect to its capability to simulate physical processes within urban environments. In this regard, it includes e.g. energy-balance solvers for building and land surfaces, a radiative transfer model to account for multiple reflections and shading, as well as a plant-canopy model to consider the effects of plants on the (thermo)dynamics of the flow. This study provides a thorough evaluation of modelled 5 meteorological, air chemistry and wall-surface quantities against dedicated in-situ measurements taken in an urban environment in Prague, Dejvice, Czech Republic. Measurements included e.g. monitoring of air quality and meteorology in street canyons, surface temperature scanning with infrared camera and monitoring of wall heat fluxes. Large-eddy simulations (LES) for multiple days within two summer and three winter episodes that are characterized by different atmospheric conditions were performed with the PALM model driven by boundary conditions obtained from a mesoscale model. For the simulated 10 episodes, the resulting temperature, wind speed and concentrations of chemical compounds within street canyons agreed well with the observations, except the LES did not adequately capture nighttime cooling near the surface at certain meteorological conditions. In some situations, less turbulent mixing was modelled resulting in higher near-surface concentrations. At most of the surface evaluation points the simulated wall-surface temperature agreed fairly well with the observed one regarding its absolute value as well as daily amplitude. However, especially for the winter episodes and for modern buildings with multi15 layer walls, the heat transfer through the wall is partly not well captured leading to discrepancies between the modelled and observed wall-surface temperature. Furthermore, we show that model results depend on the accuracy of the input data, particularly the temperatures of surfaces affected by nearby trees strongly depend on the spatial distribution of the leaf area density, land-surface temperatures at grass surfaces strongly depend on the initial soil moisture, or wall-surface temperatures depend on the correct prescription of wall material parameters, though these parameters are often not available with sufficient accuracy. 20 Moreover, we also point out current model limitations, here we particularly focus on implications with respect to the discrete representation of topography on a Cartesian grid, complex heterogeneous facades, as well as glass facades that are not well represented in terms of radiative processes.},

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth{\textquoteright}s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95\% of temperate and 90\% of tropical woodlands.

The concept of persistence has been found to have many diverse practical applications, ranging from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to financial dynamics to distribution of time scales in turbulent flows and many more. In this study, we carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical characteristics of the persistence probability density functions (PDFs) of velocity and temperature fluctuations in the surface layer of a convective boundary layer using a field-experimental dataset. Our results demonstrate that for the time scales smaller than the integral scales, the persistence PDFs of turbulent velocity and temperature fluctuations display a clear power-law behavior, associated with a self-similar eddy cascading mechanism. Moreover, we also show that the effects of non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations act only at those scales that are larger than the integral scales, where the persistence PDFs deviate from the power-law and drop exponentially. Furthermore, the mean time scales of the negative temperature fluctuation events persisting longer than the integral scales are found to be approximately equal to twice the integral scale in highly convective conditions. However, with stability, this mean time scale gradually decreases to almost being equal to the integral scale in the near-neutral conditions. Contrarily, for the long positive temperature fluctuation events, the mean time scales remain roughly equal to the integral scales, irrespective of stability.},

We discover that the persistence patterns for heat and momentum fluxes are widely different. Moreover, we uncover power-law scaling and length scales of turbulent motions that cause this behavior. Furthermore, by separating the phases and amplitudes of flux events, we explain the origin and differences between heat and momentum transfer efficiencies in convective turbulence. Our findings provide a new understanding of the connection between flow organization and flux generation mechanisms, two cornerstones of turbulence research.},

Using the Rayleigh{\textendash}B enard thermal instability as reference, a set of idealized simulations is used to show that gray zone modeling is not only a numerical challenge, but also poses dynamical difficulties. When the grid spacing falls within the CBL gray zone, grid-dependent convection can occur. The size of the initial instability structures is set by the grid spacing rather than the natural state of the flow. This changes higher-order flow statistics and poses fundamental difficulties for gray zone modeling applications.},

	url = {https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-126/},
	abstract = {The eddy-covariance method provides the most direct estimates for fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, dispersive fluxes can occur in the presence of secondary circulations, which can inherently not be captured by such 15 single-tower measurements. In this study, we present options to correct local flux measurements for such large-scale transport based on a non-local parametric model that has been developed from a set of idealized LES runs for three real-world sites. The test sites DK-Sor, DE-Fen, and DE-Gwg, represent typical conditions in the mid-latitudes with different measurement height, different terrain complexity and different landscape-scale heterogeneity. Different ways to determine the boundary-layer height, which is a necessary input variable for modelling the dispersive fluxes, are applied, either from operational radio20 soundings and local in-situ measurements for the flat site or from backscatter-intensity profile obtained from collocated ceilometers for the two sites in complex terrain. The adjusted total fluxes are evaluated by assessing the improvement in energy balance closure and by comparing the resulting latent heat fluxes with evapotranspiration rates from nearby lysimeters. The results show that not only the accuracy of the flux estimates is improved but also the precision, which is indicated by RMSE values that are reduced by approximately 50\%. Nevertheless, it needs to be clear that this method is intended to correct for a 25 bias in eddy-covariance measurements due to the presence of large-scale dispersive fluxes. Other reasons potentially causing a systematic under- or overestimation, such as low-pass filtering effects and missing storage terms, still need to be considered and minimized as much as possible. Moreover, additional transport induced by surface heterogeneities is not considered.},

	abstract = {Tropical deciduous forests are unique in terms of their geographical distribution, strong seasonality and their contribution to global carbon dynamics, but yet their carbon sequestration potential is poorly sampled. In the current study, we report the carbon balance of 65-year-old tropical dry deciduous forest in central India using the multi-year eddy covariance measurements from November 2011 to May 2019. Over the study period, the forest site was observed to be a net sink of atmospheric CO2 with a mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 524 ({\textpm} 40; {\textpm}1 SD across different years) g C m- 2 yr- 1 with a 233 ({\textpm}15) day growing season. The NEP was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) of 3358 ({\textpm} 167) g C m- 2 yr- 1 and annual carbon loss due to respiration and decomposition (Reco) of 2834 ({\textpm} 157) g C m- 2 yr- 1. The ecosystem showed a strong seasonality as a source of carbon during the leaf-off season (March to June), and as a carbon sink during the rest of the year with significant sequestration during the winter season (October to December). The intra-annual analysis sug- gested that CO2 flux is primarily controlled by canopy greenness with mean Reco/GPP ratio varying from 1.90 ({\textpm} 0.12) to 0.79 ({\textpm} 0.04) during leaf-off to leaf-on seasons. The monthly C fluxes in the growing season are found to be strongly correlated to the environmental variables rather than in the leaf-off season, while variability in monthly ecosystem respiration was better explained by air temperature during the leaf-off season than the growing season. Further, the inter-annual variability of NEP was mainly dependent on growing season length and mean annual temperature. The variations in annual GPP and Reco were directly dependent on the increase in mean annual temperature. The eddy covariance-based NEP was complemented by close independent biometric estimates, imparting confidence in our measurements. In conclusion, this tropical dry deciduous forest site is a substantial carbon sink and would add crucial information regarding carbon budgeting of tropical forests in global carbon balance models.},

            Sexual harassment in field settings brings unique challenges for prevention and response, as field research occurs outside {\textquotedblleft}typical{\textquotedblright} workplaces, often in remote locations that create additional safety concerns and new team dynamics. We report on a project that has 1) trained field project participants to recognize, report, and confront sexual harassment, and 2) investigated the perceptions, attitudes, and experiences of field researchers regarding sexual harassment. Pre-campaign surveys from four major, multi-institutional, domestic and international field projects indicate that the majority of sexual harassment reported prior to the field campaigns was hostile work environment harassment, and women were more likely to be the recipients, on average reporting 2-3 incidents each. The majority of those disclosing harassment indicated that they coped with past experiences by avoiding their harasser or downplaying incidents. Of the incidences reported (47) in post-campaign surveys of the four field teams, all fell under the category of hostile work environment and included incidents of verbal, visual, and physical harassment. Women{\textquoteright}s harassment experiences were perpetrated by men 100\% of the time, and the majority of the perpetrators were in more senior positions than the victims. Men{\textquoteright}s harassment experiences were perpetrated by a mix of women and men, and the majority came from those at the same position of seniority. Post-project surveys indicate that the training programs (taking place before the field projects) helped participants come away with more positive than negative emotions and perceptions of the training, the leadership, and their overall experiences on the field campaign.},

The high computational burden required to form an ensemble of single-realization dispersion solutions using an LES and coupled AT\&D model has, until recently, limited its use to a few proof-of-concept studies. An example of an LES model that can meet the temporal and spatial resolution and computational requirements of these applications is the joint outdoor-indoor urban large eddy simulation (JOULES). A key enabling element within JOULES is the computationally efficient graphics processing unit (GPU)-based LES, which is on the order of 150 times faster than if the LES contaminant dispersion simulations were executed on a central processing unit (CPU) computing platform. JOULES is capable of resolving the turbulence components at a suitable scale for both open terrain and urban landscapes, e.g., owing to varying environmental conditions and a diverse building topology. In this paper, we describe the JOULES modeling system, prior efforts to validate the accuracy of its meteorological simulations, and current results from an evaluation that uses ensembles of dispersion solutions for unstable, neutral, and stable static stability conditions in an open terrain environment.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) are an important tool for investigating the longstanding energy-balance-closure problem, as they provide continuous, spatially-distributed information about turbulent flow at a high temporal resolution. Former LES studies reproduced an energy-balance gap similar to the observations in the field typically amounting to 10{\textendash}30\% for heights on the order of 100 m in convective boundary layers even above homogeneous surfaces. The underestimation is caused by dispersive fluxes associated with large-scale turbulent organized structures that are not captured by single-tower measurements. However, the gap typically vanishes near the surface, i.e. at typical eddy-covariance measurement heights below 20 m, contrary to the findings from field measurements. In this study, we aim to find a LES set-up that can represent the correct magnitude of the energy-balance gap close to the surface. Therefore, we use a nested two-way coupled LES, with a fine grid that allows us to resolve fluxes and atmospheric structures at typical eddy-covariance measurement heights of 20 m. Under different stability regimes we compare three different options for lower boundary conditions featuring grassland and forest surfaces, i.e. (1) prescribed surface fluxes, (2) a land-surface model, and (3) a land-surface model in combination with a resolved canopy. We show that the use of prescribed surface fluxes and a land-surface model yields similar dispersive heat fluxes that are very small near the vegetation top for both grassland and forest surfaces. However, with the resolved forest canopy, dispersive heat fluxes are clearly larger, which we explain by a clear impact of the resolved canopy on the relationship between variance and flux{\textendash}variance similarity functions.},

	abstract = {Surface-atmosphere fluxes and their drivers vary across space and time. A growing area of interest is in downscaling, localizing, and/or resolving sub-grid scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes and drivers. Existing downscaling methods require inputs of land surface properties at relatively high spatial (e.g., sub-kilometer) and temporal (e.g., hourly) resolutions, but many observed land surface drivers are not continuously available at these resolutions. We evaluate an approach to overcome this challenge for land surface temperature (LST), a World Meteorological Organization Essential Climate Variable and a key driver for surface heat fluxes. The Chequamegon Heterogenous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors (CHEESEHEAD19) field experiment provided a scalable testbed. We downscaled LST from satellites (GOES-16 and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station [ECOSTRESS]) with further refinement using airborne hyperspectral imagery. Temporally and spatially downscaled LST compared well to independent observations from a network of 20 micrometeorological towers and piloted aircrafts in addition to Landsat-based LST retrieval and drone-based LST observed at one tower site. The downscaled 50-m hourly LST showed good relationships with tower (r2 = 0.79, RMSE = 3.5 K) and airborne (r2 = 0.75, RMSE = 2.4 K) observations over space and time, with precision lower over wetlands and lakes, and some improvement for capturing spatio-temporal variation compared to a geostationary satellite. Further downscaling to 10 m using hyperspectral imagery resolved hot and cold spots across the landscape as evidenced by independent drone LST, with significant reduction in RMSE by 1.3 K. These results demonstrate a simple pathway for multi-sensor retrieval of high space and time resolution LST.},

To maximize the utility of NEON data, we envision edge computing systems that gather, calibrate, aggregate, and ingest measurements in an integrated fashion. Edge systems will employ machine learning methods to cross-calibrate, gap-fill and provision data in near-real time to the NEON Data Portal and to High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, running ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) that assimilate the data. For the first time gridded EC data products and response functions promise to offset pervasive observational biases through evaluating, benchmarking, optimizing parameters, and training new machine learning parameterizations within ESMs all at the same model-grid scale. Leveraging open-source software for EC data analysis, we are already building software infrastructure for integration of near-real time data streams into the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package for use by the wider research community. We will present a perspective on the design and integration of end-to-end infrastructure for data acquisition, edge computing, HPC simulation, analysis, and validation, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are used throughout the distributed workflow to improve accuracy and computational performance.},

In this study, the data-driven solution was proposed to address this problem. We combined three machine learning algorithms, deep neural network, long-short term memory, and random forest, with observations from 69 FLXUNET sites to quantify instantaneous energy balance ratio (EBR), then corrected the energy imbalance-induced structural error in evapotranspiration models. The contributions of the environmental factors to the energy imbalance problem was evaluated using the Sobol sensitivity analysis. Our results showed that the data-driven methods obtained a good estimation of EBR, and further decreased the error of evapotranspiration estimation. The data-driven solution performed well from the scale of individual site to global, which demonstrated a good generalization performance. The three machine learning algorithms had similar performances on overcoming the energy imbalance-induced structural error. Friction velocity and atmospheric stability were detected as the most sensitive factors to the energy imbalance problem, which can be explained by the vital influence of advection on the energy imbalance problem. Our work provided new insight into the improvement of evapotranspiration models.},

For this purpose, this study selected multiple land flux products as reference data sets and assessed the global spatial means, patterns, trends, seasonal cycles, and regional mean estimates of the sensible heat (SH), latent heat (LH), net radiation (RN), runoff (RF), and precipitation (PR) simulated by 32 CMIP6 models in recent decades. The global (Antarctica, Greenland, and hot deserts are not included) mean SH, LH, RN, RF, and PR simulated by the CMIP6 models are 37.55 {\textpm} 4.81 W m-2, 49.88 {\textpm} 5.31 W m-2, 89.10 {\textpm} 4.45 W m-2, 351.31 {\textpm} 95.28 mm yr-1, and 948.35 {\textpm} 88.77 mm yr-1, respectively. The ensemble median of CMIP6 simulations (CMIP6-MED) can provide robust estimates of global and regional land fluxes, which are within the ranges given by the reference data sets, and highly consistent spatiotemporal patterns of these fluxes. The comparison of CMIP6-MED with the first preferred reference data sets shows that CMIP6-MED generally overestimates the water and energy fluxes over land, except for the simulated RF and PR in the Amazon region. The most disagreements between CMIP6-MED and the reference data sets occur in South America (particularly the Amazon region) and the Tibetan Plateau. Finally, the sources of model biases are discussed. It is suggested that current land flux products should be widely used to optimize the structures and parameters of climate models in future work.},

study, we present options to correct local flux measurements for such

tested for three real-world sites (DK-Sor, DE-Fen, and DE-Gwg), representing
typical conditions in the mid-latitudes with different measurement heights,
different terrain complexities, and different landscape-scale heterogeneities.
Two ways to determine the boundary-layer height, which is a necessary input
variable for modelling the dispersive fluxes, are applied, which are either based on
operational radio soundings and local in~situ measurements for the flat sites
or from backscatter-intensity profiles obtained from co-located ceilometers

evaluated by assessing the improvement in energy balance closure and by
comparing the resulting latent heat fluxes with evapotranspiration rates

RMSE values that are reduced by approximately 50 \%. Nevertheless, it needs

	abstract = {Airborne flux measurements allow us to quantify the surface{\textendash}atmosphere exchange over heterogeneous land surfaces. While often applied to regional-scale fluxes, it is also possible to infer component fluxes emanating from different surface patches from the measurement via disaggregation strategies. Here, we emulate flux disaggregation strategies by conducting an ensemble of virtual flight measurements within a set of large-eddy simulations over idealized surface heterogeneities and under different flow regimes. The resulting patch surface fluxes are compared with the prescribed patch surface fluxes in the simulation. To calculate fluxes along the flight legs, we apply traditional eddy-covariance and space{\textendash}frequency (wavelet) methods. We show that the patch fluxes are captured best with the space{\textendash}frequency method, where the disaggregation error is almost invariant of the segment length. For the eddycovariance method, however, the error strongly depends on the segment length, with largest random and systematic errors for shorter segments. Furthermore, we determine a trade-off between a permissible disaggregation error and a sufficient resolution of the heterogeneous surface signals. Among our set-ups, an optimal segment length is determined to be 3{\textendash}4 km for the eddy-covariance method, while with the space{\textendash}frequency method even shorter segment lengths of a few hundreds of metres can be chosen, which enables sufficient isolation of signals from surface patches and the resolution of small-scale surface heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Eddy-covariance fluxes serve as an essential benchmark for Earth system models and remote sensing data. However, two challenges prevent model-data intercomparisons from fully utilizing eddy-covariance fluxes. The first challenge stems from the differing and variable spatial representativeness of the eddy-covariance measurements, or footprint bias and transience. The second originates from the phenomenon of a non-closed energy balance using eddy-covariance measurements, hypothesized to result from unaccounted mesoscale flows or under-sampling of hot spots by flux towers, among others. Previous studies have suggested that these two problems can be mitigated by either building multiple towers or by applying space{\textendash}time rectification approaches, such as the environmental response function (ERF) approach. Here we ask: (1) How many eddy-flux towers do we need to sufficiently~rectify location bias, close the energy budget, and sample the regional domain? (2) Can an~advanced space{\textendash}time rectification approach reduce the tower density, while still adequately sampling~the regional flux domain? Furthermore, (3) How accurately can the ERF approach retrieve the surface-flux variation? To answer these questions, we used data from a large-eddy simulation of atmospheric flows above a heterogeneous surface as captured by an ensemble of virtual tower measurements. We calculated eddy-covariance fluxes by spatial and spatio-temporal methods. The spatial eddy-covariance method captured 89\% of the prescribed total surface energy flux with about one tower per 15~km2, while the spatio-temporal method required only one tower per 40~km2 to capture 95\% of surface energy. To capture 97\% of energy, applying the ERF approach further reduced the required tower density to one tower per 200~km2, as a result of space{\textendash}time rectification and incorporating mesoscale flows. This approach also enabled retrieving the surface spatial variation of the sensible heat flux. The results provide a reference for informing and designing future observation systems based on flux tower clusters, and scale-aware data products.},

	abstract = {Using the standard eddy-covariance (EC) method to quantify mass and energy exchange at a single location usually results in an underestimation of vertical eddy fluxes at the surface. In order to better understand the reasons for this underestimation, an experimental set-up is presented that is based on spatial averaging of air temperature data from a network of ground-based sensors over agricultural land. For eight days during the 34-day observational period in May and June 2007, additional contributions to the sensible heat flux of more than 50 W m-2 were measured in the lower surface layer by applying the spatial EC method as opposed to the standard temporal EC method. Smaller but still significant additional sensible heat fluxes were detected for four more days. The additional energy is probably transported in organised convective structures resulting in a mean vertical wind velocity unequal to zero at the tower location. The results show that convective transport contributes significantly to the surface energy budget for measurement heights as low as 2{\textendash}3 m. Since these structures may be quasi-stationary, they can hardly be captured by a single-location measurement. The spatial EC set-up presented here is capable of quantifying contributions to the sensible heat flux from structures up to the scale of our spatial sensor network, which covered an area 3.5 {\texttimes} 3.5 km. For future experiments aiming at closing the energy balance, the spatial EC method should be employed to measure both the sensible and latent heat fluxes. Experimental determination of the horizontal advection of sensible and latent heat should also be considered, since such transport must occur due to convergence and divergence related to convection.},

However, the 10-min average reflected 83 \% of the reference eddy-covariance flux with a good correlation. By introducing a combined eddy-covariance method (the spatial eddy covariance plus the additional flux of the temporal eddy covariance of the spatial mean values), the mean flux increases by 9 \% relative to the eddy-covariance reference. Considering the typical underestimation of fluxes by the standard eddy-covariance method, this is seen as an improvement. Within the limits of the Eddy Matrix, Taylor{\textquoteright}s hypothesis is supported by the results.},

	abstract = {Experimental closure of the surface energy balance during convective periods is a longstanding problem. With experimental data from the Idealized horizontal Planar Array experiment for Quantifying Surface heterogeneity, the terms of the temperature-tendency equation are computed, with an emphasis on the total derivative. The experiment occurred at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test facility at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground during the summer of 2019. The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50{\textendash}80 W m-2 (median variability of 40\%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200{\textendash}500 W m-2 (median variability of 48\% for the streamwise and 40\% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m-3 or 172 K h-1) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m-3 or 47 K h-1). Probability density functions of the total derivative from convective cases show mean volumetric heating rates of 43 W m-3 (154 K h-1) compared to 13 W m-3 (47 K h-1) on non-convective days. A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings. Of the cases examined, 83\% with streamwise and 81\% with spanwise advection during unstable periods are classified as locally driven by nearby surface thermal heterogeneities.},

	abstract = {The flux of water vapor due to advection is measured using high-resolution Raman lidar that was orientated horizontally across a land{\textendash}lake transition. At the same time, a full surface energy balance is performed to assess the impact of scalar advection on energy budget closure. The flux of water vapor due to advection is then estimated with analytical solutions to the humidity transport equation that show excellent agreement with the field measurements. Although the magnitude of the advection was not sufficient to account for the total energy deficit for this field site, the analytical approach is used to explore situations where advection would be the dominant transport mechanism. The authors find that advection is at maximum when the measurement height is 0.036 times the distance to a land surface transition. The framework proposed in this paper can be used to predict the potential impact of advection on surface flux measurements prior to field deployment and can be used as a data analysis algorithm to calculate the flux of water vapor due to advection from field measurements.},

	abstract = {The Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-Balance Study Enabled by a High-Density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 (CHEESEHEAD19) is an ongoing National Science Foundation project based on an intensive field campaign that occurred from June to October 2019. The purpose of the study is to examine how the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) responds to spatial heterogeneity in surface energy fluxes. One of the main objectives is to test whether lack of energy balance closure measured by eddy covariance (EC) towers is related to mesoscale atmospheric processes. Finally, the project evaluates data-driven methods for scaling surface energy fluxes, with the aim to improve model{\textendash}data comparison and integration. To address these questions, an extensive suite of ground, tower, profiling, and airborne instrumentation was deployed over a 10 km {\texttimes} 10 km domain of a heterogeneous forest ecosystem in the Chequamegon{\textendash}Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin, United States, centered on an existing 447-m tower that anchors an AmeriFlux/NOAA supersite (US-PFa/WLEF). The project deployed one of the world{\textquoteright}s highest-density networks of above-canopy EC measurements of surface energy fluxes. This tower EC network was coupled with spatial measurements of EC fluxes from aircraft; maps of leaf and canopy properties derived from airborne spectroscopy, ground-based measurements of plant productivity, phenology, and physiology; and atmospheric profiles of wind, water vapor, and temperature using radar, sodar, lidar, microwave radiometers, infrared interferometers, and radiosondes. These observations are being used with large-eddy simulation and scaling experiments to better understand submesoscale processes and improve formulations of subgrid-scale processes in numerical weather and climate models.},

	abstract = {We present the annual patterns of net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange (NEE) of CO2 and H2O observed from a 447 m tall tower sited within a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA. The methodology for determining NEE from eddy-covariance flux measurements at 30, 122 and 396 m above the ground, and from CO2 mixing ratio measurements at 11, 30, 76, 122, 244 and 396 m is described. The annual cycle of CO2 mixing ratio in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is also discussed, and the influences of local NEE and large-scale advection are estimated. During 1997 gross ecosystem productivity (947-18 g C m-2 yr-1), approximately balanced total ecosystem respiration (963{\textpm}19 g C m-2 yr-1), and NEE of CO2 was close to zero (16{\textpm}19 g C m-2 yr-1 emitted into the atmosphere). The error bars represent the standard error of the cumulative daily NEE values. Systematic errors are also assessed. The identified systematic uncertainties in NEE of CO2 are less than 60 g C m-2 yr-1. The seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2 was highly correlated with leaf-out and leaf-fall, and soil thaw and freeze, and was similar to purely deciduous forest sites. The mean daily NEE of CO2 during the growing season (June through August) was -1.3 g C m-2 day-1, smaller than has been reported for other deciduous forest sites. NEE of water vapor largely followed the seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2, with a lag in the spring when water vapor fluxes increased before CO2 uptake. In general, the Bowen ratios were high during the dormant seasons and low during the growing season. Evapotranspiration normalized by potential evapotranspiration showed the opposite pattern. The seasonal course of the CO2 mixing ratio in the ABL at the tower led the seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2 in time: in spring, CO2 mixing ratios began to decrease prior to the onset of daily net uptake of CO2 by the forest, and in fall mixing ratios began to increase before the forest became a net source for CO2 to the atmosphere. Transport as well as local NEE of CO2 are shown to be important components of the ABL CO2 budget at all times of the year.},

	abstract = {Significant advances have been made over the past decades in capabilities to simulate diurnal and seasonal variation of leaf-level and canopy-scale photosynthesis in temperate and boreal forests. However, long-term prediction of future forest productivity in a changing climate may be more dependent on how climate and biological anomalies influence extremes in interannual to decadal variability of canopy ecosystem carbon exchanges. These exchanges can differ markedly from leaf level responses, especially owing to the prevalence of long lags in nutrient and water cycling. Until recently, multiple long-term (10? year) high temporal frequency (daily) observations of canopy exchange were not available to reliably assess this claim. An analysis of one of the longest running North American eddy covariance flux towers reveals that single climate variables do not adequately explain carbon exchange anomalies beyond the seasonal timescale. Daily to weekly lagged anomalies of photosynthesis positively autocorrelate with daily photosynthesis. This effect suggests a negative feedback in photosynthetic response to climate extremes, such as anomalies in evapotranspiration and maximum temperature. Moisture stress in the prior season did inhibit photosynthesis, but mechanisms are difficult to assess. A complex interplay of integrated and lagged productivity and moisture-limiting factors indicate a critical role of seasonal thresholds that limit growing season length and peak productivity. These results lead toward a new conceptual framework for improving earth system models with long-term flux tower observations.},

The footprints were weighted by the measured value of ET to give the footprint that determines the ET flux. The resulting footprint climatology was used to investigate the effect of different averaging times, from a single day to a whole season. The climatology defined the area where 90\% of ET originates as a reasonable indicator of the most important part of the landscape sampled. The analysis showed that two 12-m high towers would be needed to fully sample the 90\% footprint contour of ET in the 0.5 km2 catchment study area on a seasonal basis. We conclude that it would be difficult to use micrometeorological techniques to monitor ET without doing a quantitative footprint analysis to define the sampled area. q 1998 Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.

	abstract = {A meaningful interpretation of airborne flux estimates over nonuniform terrain must consider local advection from nonhomogeneous source distributions (footprint correction). An empirical procedure for footprint correction of airborne flux data obtained in the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) 1989 is presented, based on simple analytical solutions of the diffusion equation which have been adjusted to approximate more realistic solutions. Optimized estimates of surface flux {\textquotedblleft}maps{\textquotedblright} derived from airborne observations are then constructed for maximum correlation between flux estimates and independently observed surface characteristics. This paper also includes an analysis of resolution for the given procedure, in terms of amplitude recovery of hypothetical square-wave distributions of surface flux density, and discusses its implications for the interpretation of the optimized estimates of FIFE surface flux maps. Results show that corrected spatial sink distributions are obtained by the current empirical procedure at the cost of considerable reduction in amplitude recovery of small-scale variations in surface flux density. The high spatial correlation observed between corrected flux maps and surface characteristics such as greenness or surface temperature excess is ascribed to the approximately correct positioning of the main flux gradients across the site, which can be expected to have been reproduced with amplitude recovery of >=60\%.},

	abstract = {Clouds are a critical component of the Earth's coupled water and energy cycles. Poor understanding of cloud{\textendash}radiation{\textendash}dynamics feedbacks results in large uncertainties in forecasting human-induced climate changes. Better understanding of cloud microphysical and dynamical processes is critical to improving cloud parameterizations in climate models as well as in cloud-resolving models. Airborne in situ and remote sensing can make critical contributions to progress. Here, a new integrated cloud observation capability developed for the University of Wyoming King Air is described. The suite of instruments includes the Wyoming Cloud Lidar, a 183- GHz microwave radiometer, the Wyoming Cloud Radar, and in situ probes. Combined use of these remote sensor measurements yields more complete descriptions of the vertical structure of cloud microphysical properties and of cloud-scale dynamics than that attainable through ground-based remote sensing or in situ sampling alone. Together with detailed in situ data on aerosols, hydrometeors, water vapor, thermodynamic, and air motion parameters, an advanced observational capability was created to study cloud-scale processes from a single aircraft. The Wyoming Airborne Integrated Cloud Observation (WAICO) experiment was conducted to demonstrate these new capabilities and examples are presented to illustrate the results obtained.},
